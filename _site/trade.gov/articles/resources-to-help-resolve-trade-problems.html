<div class="content"> Protecting Intellectual Property Rights Abroad 
 Learn what constitutes intellectual property and how to protect your rights domestically and internationally. Receive guidance on how to file patents, trademarks and/or copyrights in the U.S. and abroad. 
 Fair Access to Foreign Contracts 
 How can I insure a fair bidding process on a foreign contract? 
 If your company is bidding on a foreign contract the Advocacy Center can help level the playing field. 
 Problems with Dumped or Subsidized Imports 
 @#$% your business harmed by unfairly traded imports? Import Administration's Petition Counseling experts are here to help you understand the optionsavailable under the U.S. unfair trade laws. Our staff can assist you in understanding the petition process for an investigation of the unfairly traded imports, guide you in compiling the information necessary for a petition, and review your draft petition to help ensure it meets the requirements for a potential investigation. 
 If your company is interested in tracking, researching, and/or participating in ongoing U.S. antidumping/countervailing duty proceedings, learn more about these proceedings on the Import Administration website. 
 Addressing Unfair Foreign Government Subsidies 
 Are You Being Harmed by Unfair Foreign Government Subsidies? 
 Import Administration's Subsidies Enforcement Office will answer your questions regarding foreign subsidy practices and the tools available to stop unfairly subsidized imports from hurting your business. We continually monitor and evaluate foreign subsidy practices and can assist you in identifying those that can be remedied under the Subsidies Agreement of the World Trade Organization or under the U.S. countervailing duty law. 
 Foreign Trade Remedy Investigations 
 If you find yourself facing a foreign government's trade remedy (e.g., antidumping, countervailing duty or safeguard) investigation of your exports to that country, don't panic, but do act quickly. Import Administration's Trade Remedy Compliance Staff (TRCS) and Subsidies Enforcement Office (SEO) are your first stop for questions and concerns regarding foreign trade remedy actions. TRCS can assist you to better understand what you will be facing in foreign antidumping and safeguards investigations and the SEO can do the same for foreign countervailing duty (anti-subsidy) cases. We can point out deadlines you won't want to miss, and provide support to help ensure that the foreign authorities conduct the investigation fairly and according to international rules. 
 Foreign Technical Barriers to Trade 
 Member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are required under the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement) to report to the WTO all proposed technical regulations that could affect trade with other Member countries. 
 Notify U.S. is a free, web-based e-mail subscription service that offers an opportunity to review and comment on proposed foreign technical regulations that can affect your access to international markets. 
 Trade Assistance for U.S. Firms and Workers 
 Globalization has greatly increased competition at home for U.S. companies. Now, more than ever, it is important to understand your rights and be aware of existing U.S. policies and programs that ensure fair competition and provide transition assistance to affected workers. 
 The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) services and benefits helps manufacturing workers adversely affected by increased international trade. The program can help you pay for technical assistance to lessen the impact of trade on your company. 
 If you are a producer of a commodity which has recently suffered from low prices due to increasing imports, you may be eligible for technical assistance and a financial payment under this program. 
 Report a Trade Barrier 
 If you feel your company's exports or foreign bids have been, or may be adversely affected by a trade barrier or unfair business practice, you may file a complaint electronically with the Trade Compliance Center within the International Trade Administration.
