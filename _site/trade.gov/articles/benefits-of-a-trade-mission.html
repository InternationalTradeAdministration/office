<time>January 11, 2013</time>
<div class="content"> In 2010, companies anticipated almost USD $2 billion in export sales as a direct result of participation in a trade mission. Some of the benefits they enjoyed were: 
 
  Access to High-level Officials 
 Many trade missions will be led by a senior level United States Government official and many trade missions will include meetings with senior level government officials in industry relevant ministries. 
 Ability to Meet Other U.S. Firms Interested in the Same Market 
 Synergies are often created between trade mission participants through their sharing of market information and valuable networking. 
 Market Briefings 
 Participating companies receive market briefings from local experts including law, finance, operations, and sales strategies. Market briefings may be followed by site visits to key projects or to gain an understanding of how to do business in the market. 
 One-on-One Appointments 
 Appointments are scheduled by U.S. Commercial Service trade specialists for mission delegates to meet with potential overseas buyers. 
 Events/Receptions/Media Coverage 
 Participating companies may be invited to receptions at the U.S. Embassy or related events that create positive opportunities for participating companies to further develop relationships with high-level decision makers.
