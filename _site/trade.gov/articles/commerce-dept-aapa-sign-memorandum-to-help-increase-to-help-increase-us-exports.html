 “Committing to work together to help increase U.S. exports, the American Association of Port Authorities (&lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --&gt;&lt;!-- .http://www.aapa-ports.org/home.cfm. --&gt;AAPA) and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration (ITA) today signed a Memorandum of Intent (MOI) at the Port of Oakland.  This historic MOI implementing the “Partnership with America’s Seaports to Further the National Export Initiative” supports President Obama’s goal of doubling exports announced during his State of the Union speech in 2010.  Under the agreement, ITA and AAPA will partner to coordinate communications, idea exchanges, activities and services that assist U.S. businesses in exporting; and to increase awareness of the available services, trade missions, programs and overseas events that involve U.S. export opportunities.”
