 Every year, thousands of eBayers gather in one place to trade success stories and learn about the latest developments in e-commerce. Joining them in Boston last month for the second consecutive year was a team of international trade exerts from the U.S. Commercial Service (CS). 
 Because eBay users are starting to sell worldwide, CS and eBay have partnered to help more U.S. businesses export. International sales are a growing part of eBay’s business, and customers are finding that the technology and payment systems can reach a big chunk of the 95% of the world’s consumers who don’t live in the U.S. 
 CS and eBay staff operated the International Trading booth, advising eBay users about selling internationally and answering questions ranging from duties imposed by different countries to how to fill out export declaration paperwork (no declarations needed on sales of less than $2500). 
 Future events to be held around the country will feature CS, eBay and other partners 








 With its network of offices across the United States and in more than 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration utilizes its global presence and international marketing expertise to help U.S. companies sell their products and services worldwide.
