<div class="content"> The U.S. Environmental Solutions Toolkit is a buyer’s resource guide that marries EPA expertise on solving environmental challenges with a catalogue of U.S. providers of related technologies. Four initial environmental issues have been identified based on their broad applicability for international markets. More areas will be added. 
 Click on any of the environmental solutions below for a list of participating U.S. providers:

 Mercury Emissions Control from Power Plants 
 Non-road Diesel Emissions Control 
  
 The U.S. Environmental Solutions Toolkit supports the President’s National Export Initiative by fostering export opportunities for the U.S. environmental industry as well as advancing environmental protection goals. The full toolkit, with a comprehensive listing of environmental solutions, will be available in early 2013. 
 U.S. environmental technology or services companies that would like to be listed as solution providers should send inquires to envirotech@trade.gov.
