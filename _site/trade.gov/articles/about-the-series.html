<div class="content"> “Competing in the 21st Century: Navigating the Global Marketplace” 
 WHAT:  
 The Commerce Department’s International Trade Administration, in partnership with the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, and several strategic regional partners, has developed a no-cost, one-day seminar that highlights the broad range of international opportunities in the Western Hemisphere, created through the success of existing free trade agreements in the region. Seminar participants will engage senior government representatives and other experts on key issues related to the U.S. economy and the global marketplace. 
 WHY: 
 The Western Hemisphere is an ideal export market for potential entrepreneurs, as well as existing U.S. companies. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), in part due to geographic proximity, has given U.S. products a substantial competitive edge over goods from other countries. 
 Technological advances, coupled with increasing consumer demands abroad, have created unparalleled opportunities for U.S. companies seeking to introduce their products and services to the international marketplace. The commercial success of several free trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere (NAFTA, U.S.- Chile, CAFTA-DR) make the region a strategic and profitable business prospect for U.S. companies. There is also an increasing need for a well-trained, globally-focused workforce capable of supporting American business interests abroad. 
 The purpose of this event is to increase the knowledge of business owners concerning the export opportunities in the Region and increase their understanding of the overall benefits of free trade. Presenters will also discuss the broad range of career opportunities in the fields of international affairs and trade policy. 
 WHO: 
 Are you an aspiring entrepreneur with a unique idea, but in need of additional resources or tools to conduct crucial research that will enable you to successfully introduce your product or service to a foreign market? Are you an existing small, medium-sized, or minority-owned U.S. company looking to expand your customer base? Are you a faculty member or student of an academic institution who desires a greater understanding of the global job market, and how U.S. exports support the U.S. economy? Are you interested in a career in the field of international business? Then you would benefit from attending this event. 
 WHEN: 
 These seminars are taking place on the campuses of minority serving institutions across the United States. The program includes keynote speakers, panel discussions, and valuable networking opportunities with representatives from government, industry, academia, and regional international trade associations. The strategic alliance between minority serving institutions and the local minority business community was a key factor in developing the model for this unique seminar series.
