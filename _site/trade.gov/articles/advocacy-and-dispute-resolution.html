  Need help pursuing foreign government procurements or projects? 
 Leverage the resources and influence of the U.S. Government to level the playing field. The U.S. Governmentâ€™s Advocacy Center has helped hundreds of U.S. companies -- small, medium and large enterprises -- in various industry sectors win government contracts across the globe. 
 The assistance provided by the Advocacy Center is wide and varied but often involves the U.S. Government communicating a message to foreign governments or government-owned corporations so that your company receives fair treatment when pursuing foreign government procurements or projects.

   Need help resolving payment disputes with foreign companies? 
 When negotiations with a foreign company to resolve payment disputes fail and the sum involved is large enough to warrant the effort, your company should first obtain the assistance and advice of its bank and legal counsel. 
 Once your company has obtained the assistance and advice of its bank and legal counsel, then your company can leverage the resources and authority of the U.S. Government to settle the dispute. 
   Contact a local Export Assistance Center for payment disputes
