<div class="content"> Guam 
 As a U.S. territory, Guam has no duty or quota requirements applicable on shipments to Territory of Guam. 
 However, there are fees and other requirements that apply to the type of importation and business. 
  $5.00 procession fee for all shipments of cargo entering the Territory. 
 Business license required prior to engaging in any business issued by the Department of Revenue and Taxation. 
 4% gross receipt tax on all merchandise sold in Guam. 
 4% use tax on all items imported for personal or business use. 
  Puerto Rico 
 As a U.S. territory, shipments to Puerto Rico are not considered exports so duties are not applied. 
 There is, however, a state sales tax of 5.5% and a municipal sales tax that can vary from 0% to 1.5 percent. Thus, taxes on consumption (levied to the end user) will vary from 5.5% to 7%. 
 U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) 
 U. S. origin items shipped to the USVI are exempt from duties; however they will be subject to an excise tax. These taxes range from 0 to 6%. A few items, like cigarettes, are taxed at a higher level. Alcoholic beverages are subject to a flat rate based on volume. 
 Non-U.S. origin goods will be subject to a duty equal to the difference between the 6% the USVI normally levies on imports and whatever duty was paid on these items when they entered the U.S.( If there was a 5% duty charged at entry into the U.S., there would be an additional 1% charged upon entry into the USVI.) 
 For additional information about excise taxes, you can call the USVI excise tax office on 340-773-3766.
