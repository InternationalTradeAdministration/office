 EC&amp;M is a leading manufacturer of AC and DC electrical control and auxiliary equipment for heavy-duty overhead cranes. Originally established in 1897 in Cleveland, Ohio, EC&amp;M Company operated for 60 years until Square D Company purchased it in the mid 1950's and moved to South Carolina. 
 In 2003, two Square D manufacturing executives purchased the product line from Square D and re-established the century old EC&amp;M brand. EC&amp;M now operates from its 86,000 square foot factory in St. Matthews, South Carolina. 
 The U.S. Commercial Service and the S.C. Department of Commerce first began working with EC&amp;M in August of 2005. Since then, Managing Director Keith Hudgins has attended training sessions and received counseling including export finance counseling. 
 In the fall of 2006, Keith applied to participate in the S.C. China Export Service, a joint effort of the U.S. Commercial Service and the S.C. Department of Commerce. Through this service, he received counseling on market opportunities in China for EC&amp;M from USCS commercial specialists in 5 China locations. Using the counseling provided by these Coalition members, EC&amp;M completed their first sale to China in March of this year.
