 Gold Eagle Company is a manufacturer and distributor of aftermarket fluids and additives including branded engine performance and maintenance chemicals for the motor vehicle industry. As a client of Trade Specialist Robin Mugford, Libertyville Export Assistance Center, they receive all of the information that is disseminated by the Automotive Team. 
 Commercial Specialist Isolda Frias, U.S. Commercial Service Santo Domingo, sent a trade lead to all members of the Automotive Team in December 2005 on behalf of her client Importadora La Plaza who was looking for U.S. suppliers of engine lubricating oils. TS Mugford passed the lead on to Richard Schwab, Vice President of International Sales, who expressed an interest and followed-up with the firm. In addition, Mr. Schwab traveled to the Dominican Republic and met with Importadora in person, an appointment arranged by Specialist Frias. 
 As a result of these efforts, a sale in the amount of $48, 677.00 was made. Gold Eagle is doing business in Central America and the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has helped them increase sales over the past two years. 
 With its network of offices across the United States and in more than 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration utilizes its global presence and international marketing expertise to help U.S. companies sell their products and services worldwide.
