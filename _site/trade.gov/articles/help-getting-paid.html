<div class="content"> In international trade, problems involving bad debts are more easily avoided than rectified after they occur. Credit checks and services such as the international company profile can also limit the risks. 
 When payment problems occur, answer the following questions before seeking outside help or filing an insurance claim: 
  Have you contacted the buyer to determine the problem? 
 Have you attempted to negotiate a mutually agreed solution to the problem? 
 Have you supplied the goods/services as per the contract, invoice, letter of credit? 
 Is there an issue of quality or price? 
 Are all your shipping and customs documents in order? 
 Was there damage or theft? 
 Have you tried to work out delayed payment terms with the buyer? 
 Have you discussed your problem with your bank? With a lawyer? 
 Have you exhausted all efforts to obtain payment from the foreign buyer? 
 Do you have copies of all correspondence and records related to the dispute? 
  Help With Payment Disputes 
 If negotiations fail and the sum involved is large enough to warrant the effort, a company should obtain the assistance and advice of its bank, legal counsel, and other qualified experts.
