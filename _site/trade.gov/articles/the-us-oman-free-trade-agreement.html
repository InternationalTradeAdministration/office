<div class="content"> General Information 
 The U.S.-Oman FTA represents an important tool to foster continued economic engagement with Oman, open opportunities for U.S. farmers, manufacturers and services providers, and improve economic ties with a key U.S. ally. The FTA went into force on January 1, 2009. 
 The FTA between the United States and Oman spurs U.S. trade with Oman in goods and services by eliminating most tariff and nontariff barriers. Under the market access provisions of the FTA, the United States and Oman provided each other immediate duty-free access for tariff lines covering almost all consumer and industrial goods and 87% of all agricultural tariff lines. Both countries agreed to phase out all tariffs on the remaining eligible goods within 10 years. 
 The FTA contains trade facilitation measures designed to expedite the movement of goods and the provision of services between Oman and the United States; investment provisions intended to strengthen protections for U.S. investors operating in Oman, including allowing them to fully own a business without a local partner; and provisions on safeguards, intellectual property rights, government procurement, labor, environment, and dispute settlement to improve the regulatory climate for bilateral trade and investment. 
 By Sector 
 In 2010, U.S. exports to Oman totaled $1.1 billion. Growth sectors included organic chemicals, optical and medical instruments, plastics, and iron and steel products. Principal U.S. exports to Oman in 2010 were vehicles, machinery, and electrical machinery.
