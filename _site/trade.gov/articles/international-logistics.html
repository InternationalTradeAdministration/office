<div class="content"> When shipping a product overseas as part of a commercial transaction, the exporter must be aware of packing, labeling, documentation, and insurance requirements. 
 To ship a product overseas, exporters have at least four options. Many exporters rely on an international freight forwarder to perform these services. Some companies utilize the services of Shippers’ Associations. Other companies use express delivery or mail services. It is also possible for exporters to arrange their own shipping. 
 You can find out more about shipping at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection web site. Exporters should evaluate each option to determine which one works best for their unique situation.

 Schedule B and HS Numbers 
 The Harmonized System (HS) assigns a 6-digit number to each product that is traded internationally. Each country can assign, on its own, four additional numbers, making the entire number 10 digits. The United States does this with its Schedule B system. 
 Tariffs and Import Fees 
 Tariffs or duties are a tax levied by governments on the value of products imported from one country into another. Before you export to any country, you need to determine what the tariff rate is on your product(s) as well as any import fees for that country. 
 Common Export Documents 
 There are many common export documents that have to accompany export shipments including the Shipper’s Export Declaration, invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin… and the list goes on.
