<div class="content"> The Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Export Initiative includes 23 commitments from 8 different federal agencies (Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, U.S. Trade Representative, State Department, U.S. Trade and Development Agency, Export-Import Bank of the United States, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and U.S. Department of Agriculture) for new programs, actions, or deliverables that will help address the major export barriers facing U.S. renewable energy and energy efficiency (RE&amp;EE) companies. Developed to both meet the goals of the National Export Initiative and President Obama’s goal of becoming the leading exporter of clean energy technologies, the Initiative will provide new and more innovative financing mechanisms for U.S. RE&amp;EE exporters, will 
 
   recommit the U.S. Government to addressing trade barriers in the sector,  
  increase the amount of trade promotion activities for RE&amp;EE companies, and  
  improve the delivery of U.S. Government export promotion services for U.S. RE&amp;EE companies.  
  
 On October 3, 2011, the RE&amp;EE Export Initiative (RE4I) Annual Review was released, showing that it is on track to increase RE&amp;EE exports, with all commitments either achieved or in the process of being completed.
