<time>February 1, 2013</time>
<div class="content"> To support more U.S. trade shows, the U.S. Commercial Service is piloting a new service called IBP Select. Like the regular IBP service, the core value proposition of IBP Select is that the U.S. Commercial Service recruits pre-screened international buyers to U.S. trade shows to meet with U.S suppliers exhibiting at those shows. The main difference between IBP and IBP Select is that IBP offers worldwide promotion and recruitment whereas Select focuses on promotion and recruitment in no more than five international markets. 
 Differences between IPB and IPB Select 
  IBP Select Service is a great value for smaller shows (under 1,200 exhibitors/under 20,000 attendees), shows that are ready to make the strategic shift and focus on international attendance, and shows that are in niche/specialty sectors. 
 IBP Select is essentially the same service as the regular IBP, except: 
  Recruitment of foreign buyer delegations is limited to 5 delegations 
 CS staffing at the venue will be 2 Global Teams members versus 1 IBP Project Officer and 2 Global Teams members. (The IBP Office will still handle all administrative aspects of the IBP, e.g., MOA, cost recovery, etc.) 
 Price is $5,000 versus $9,800 
 Show organizer only provide 900 square feet for the International Business Center versus 1,600 square feet 
  IBP-recruited delegates would continue to receive either waived or significantly reduced admission to the event. 
 Delegation leaders recruiting a minimum of 10 delegates would be eligible for a complimentary hotel room.
