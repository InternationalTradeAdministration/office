 What Our Clients Tell Us: 
 "What is truly remarkable is that World Franchise Solutions did not fly thousands of miles around the world, through 18 time zones, nor incur hotel and related expenses, nor lose time away from the business in the United States, but simply spent $3 travelling to the local Department of Commerce office."
