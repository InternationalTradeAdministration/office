 White House Releases Report to the President on the National Export Initiative 
 The White House released a report to the President on the National Export Initiative (NEI). The report outlines ways the U.S. government can expand efforts to help U.S. businesses win more foreign government contracts, find buyers worldwide, participate in more trade missions and trade shows, receive more export financing, and learn new ways to sell products and services overseas.  A central focus of the plan is providing additional assistance to small and medium-sized businesses, which are major drivers of new job creation.

 National Export Initiative Webinar 
 August 16th, 2010 – Francisco Sánchez, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, encouraged the 50 state and five territorial governors to invest in creating and/or intensifying their efforts on exports during the first-ever National Export Initiative (NEI) webinar.  Courtney Gregoire, NEI Director for the International Trade Administration (ITA); and Taline Sanassarian from the Small Business Administration (SBA) provided an overview of the NEI, its goals, and the steps ITA and SBA are taking to implement the initiative. They also discussed federal and state coordination in support of the NEI, and highlighted state-based export initiatives as models for other states to consider.  The webinar concluded by discussing innovative efforts that are underway in Arkansas, Florida, and Washington, which support the NEI.
