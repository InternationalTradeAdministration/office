<div class="content"> The International Buyer Program (IBP) is a joint government-industry effort that brings thousands of international buyers to the United States for business-to-business matchmaking with U.S. firms exhibiting at major industry trade shows. Every year, the IBP results in approximately a billion dollars in new business for U.S. companies, and increased international attendance for participating U.S. trade show organizers. 
 Whether you are a show organizer, U.S. exhibitor, or international buyer, we can help you grow your business. 
 The U.S. Commercial Service expects to issue the results of this process by May 2013. If you applied and are accepted into the CY 2014 program, a signed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) along with applicable program fee will be required within 45 days of the written notification of acceptance into the 2014 IBP. A sample MOA is provided through the link below for reference purposes only. The MOA outlines the terms of participation that accepted applicants must commit to if accepted into the program. The Federal Register Notice (available through the link below) sets forth objectives, procedures and application review criteria associated with support for domestic trade shows by the IBP. 
 2014 IBP Application -- annual application period is now closed.
