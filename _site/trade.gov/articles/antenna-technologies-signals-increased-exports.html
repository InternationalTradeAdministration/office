 Antenna Technologies Corporation, Inc. (ATCi), located in Chandler, Arizona, is a small satellite technology communications company. The company manufactures a unique product: a multi-beam antenna, which allows customers to receive signal from up to 35 satellites simultaneously used in the broadcast industry. The company has been around since 1979 and employs approximately 50 people. ATCi has been serving a wide variety of industries including Cable TV, broadcast &amp; media, TV-Radio, telecommunications, teleports, government-the military in particular-as well as Fortune 500 corporate businesses with its antennas, fiber optics and digital headend turn key solutions. 
 Due to the global nature of the satellite industry, ATCi naturally found its way into exporting. ATCi turned to Trade Specialist Dan Bjerk of the U.S. Export Assistance Center in Phoenix for help in the development of market entry strategies for various global regions. Bjerk knows the importance of good international relationships and has knowledge of the biggest challenges in international business. 
 Prior to 2002, ATCi did not have a dedicated international sales staff. The company's international sales often resulted from orders from other U.S. companies that were destined for export or from the occasional lead received at trade shows. But with the opening of a division specifically dedicated to international sales, ATCi needed to learn to direct its satellite offerings toward new global markets. Working with the U.S. Commercial Service, ATCi has participated in many different programs to help increase international sales, including teleconferencing, the Gold Key Matching Service, international seminars, catalog shows. These programs facilitated meetings with numerous international delegates, potential resellers, agents and distributors, which eventually led to partnerships. ATCi now exports to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Russia, China, Asia Pacific, South Asia and India. They also have offices in China, Brazil, Mexico, Netherlands, and Colombia. 
 Gunnar Light, Managing Director of Sales and Business Development of ATCi, Inc., has watched the company benefit from exporting through the assistance of the Commercial Service. The company has increased export sales from less than 5% to more than 33% and has exported close to $10 million worth of products to Latin America, as well as a recent shipment of $1 million to Asia Pacific.  
   
 Due to ATCi's exporting success, the company was awarded the Export Achievement Certificate in 2003 by the Assistant Secretary and Director General of the Commercial Service.
