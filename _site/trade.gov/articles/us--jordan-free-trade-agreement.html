<time>January 4, 2013</time>
<div class="content"> The U.S. – Jordan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) entered into force on December 17, 2001. The FTA will eventually eliminate duties and commercial barriers to bilateral trade in goods and services originating in the United States and Jordan. The FTA also includes – for the first time ever in the text of a trade agreement – provisions addressing trade and environment (Article 5), trade and labor (Article 6), and electronic commerce (Article 7). Other provisions address intellectual property rights protection(Article 4), balance of payments (Article 11), rules of origin(Article 14), safeguards (Article 10) and procedural matters (Articles 16 and 17). Because the United States already has a Bilateral Investment Treaty with Jordan, the FTA does not include an investment chapter. 
 In order to take advantage of the benefits for U.S. goods under this agreement, exporters will need to understand how to determine that their goods originate or qualify for preferential duty treatment under the U.S. – Jordan FTA Rules of Origin. 
 Some may find the process of qualifying one’s goods to be rather complicated. US exporters will find information here to help guide them through the process. Users of this site should keep in mind, however, that the text of the U.S.-Jordan FTA and the customs regulations of Jordan are the only definitive resources regarding qualification. 
 Under the U.S.-Jordan FTA, Jordan is obligated to adopt stronger protection and enforcement provisions for copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. The FTA will also open the Jordanian services market to US companies. These changes, among others, will provide US and Jordanian businesses with a market base that is more accessible and easily navigated. 
 The Department of Commerce's Market Access and Compliance offices monitor this Agreement to ensure that Jordan fully complies with its trade obligations. If you encounter problems under the U.S. – Jordan FTA, please contact our Agreements Compliance office.
