<div class="content"> A problem that occasionally faces all exporters, and not only companies just beginning to export, is what to do when your foreign partner or buyer is not adhering to an established agreement. Parties entering an international contract can consider alternative methods of resolving disputes outside of the courtroom. These methods, which are generally known as Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), offer neutral mechanisms for resolving disputes that may arise and can include arbitration, conciliation and mediation. 
 Arbitration 
 Arbitration is a primary form of ADR by which the parties agree to submit their disputes to an arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators. Arbitrators have binding authority to render awards that are enforceable in the courts of most countries. Arbitration is often less costly, less litigious, and less time-consuming, and offers more privacy to the parties than litigation. 
 The parties agree to arbitration in the event of a dispute in the contracting stage by including an arbitration clause in their contract. Depending on what the parties have agreed to, either the parties will choose their own arbitrators and procedures (ad hoc arbitration) or submit their dispute to an arbitral institution. 
 There are many different arbitral institutions to which parties may turn in the event of a dispute. A number of regional institutions as well as additional information on arbitration may be found with the Office of the General Counsel. 
 Mediation and Conciliation 
 Mediation, also known as conciliation, is a process in which parties to a dispute appoint a neutral third party to assist them in resolving their disputes. Unlike a judge or an arbitrator, the mediator does not have the power to compel the parties to accept a recommended solution. The goal of mediation is a voluntary negotiated settlement. 
 Informal Assistance 
 Depending on the dispute, the U.S. Embassy or consulate offices may be contacted to attempt to assist the parties in resolving their disputes. 
 The U.S. Government may provide informal assistance in resolving trade disputes arising between American and foreign businesses at the request of either party. Such assistance is limited to informal, conciliatory efforts directed toward removing misunderstandings between the businesses concerned so that they may settle their differences through friendly relations. 
 The U.S. Government cannot adjudicate, arbitrate, mediate or provide any kind of ADD to parties in trade disputes. 
 Additional Resources 
 Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce 
 The Commerce Department's Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce has posted useful background information on its website. Focusing mostly on export and investment issues, this website contains resources on various legal issues facing exporters. 
 District Export Councils 
 The national and local District Export Councils (DECs) are organizations of leaders from the local business community, whose knowledge of international business provides a source of professional advice for local firms. Many DEC members are practicing attorneys. For more than 25 years, DECs have served the U.S. by assisting companies in their local communities export. 
 American Bar Association 
 Another useful source for legal information is the American Bar Association (ABA). The ABA publishes numerous books on the subject of international business. Some of these publications include guides to the legal aspects of doing business in specific countries and guides to foreign law firms and law groups abroad. 
 Export Legal Assistance Network 
 The Export Legal Assistance Network (ELAN) program is a nationwide group of attorneys in private law firms that volunteer to provide an initial legal consultation free of charge to companies just beginning to export. Under ELAN, knowledgeable lawyers help new export companies learn the legal aspects of international trade, issues relating to export licensing, domestic and foreign taxation, tariffs, and intellectual property rights are just some of the topics covered.
