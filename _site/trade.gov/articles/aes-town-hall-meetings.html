<div class="content"> The Foreign Trade Division (FTD), is sponsoringÂ Town Hall Meetingsin five cities throughout the United States. The U.S Census Bureau experts will carefully explain the changes from the Foreign Trade Statistics Regulations to the new Foreign Trade Regulations, to assist the trade community in understanding the new reporting requirements to avoid significant penalties for noncompliance. The experts will help participants understand the legal requirements and penalty provisions regarding export regulations, with a goal in mind to keep the trade community up to date on the expert regulations.
