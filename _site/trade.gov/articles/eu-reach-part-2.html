 REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals) is a major reform of EU chemicals policy, affecting all global supply chains that produce and use chemicals.  It is particularly important for small- and medium-sized companies to know about requirements under REACH and how to comply with this regulation, in force in all EU Member States since June 2007.  This two-part series addresses REACH Fundamentals and CLP Transition and Supply Chain Compliance. In this webinar, EU REACH Part 2, it will talk about the communication challenges, CLP transition and Supply Chain Compliance, a summary of day one and introduction to the CLP Regulation on the Classification, Labeling and Packaging of Chemicals, CLP: Transition to 2015 – DSD and GHS influences on CLP; roles and obligations of supply chain members; classification types and methodologies; notifications; CLP and Safety Data Sheets. It will also cover protecting your supply chain, how REACH impacts supply chains – from the initial chemical manufacturer to the end use of the chemical, mixture or article in Europe; assessing and managing risks to your European sales.
