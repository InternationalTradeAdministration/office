 Insure Export Transactions with the Export-Import Bank 
 Ex-Im Bank's export credit insurance policies enables U.S. exporters to both finance their export activities and mitigate the risk of non-payment. The policies below enable you to offer credit to your international buyers and access working capital funds. 
  The Express Insurance Program is a "named buyer" policy that simplifies small business access to export credit risk insurance on their foreign accounts receivable. It also has a streamlined online application provides a policy quote and credit decisions up to $300,000 on foreign buyers within five workdays (buyer credit requests exceeding $300,000 will require additional processing time). 
 The Small Business Export Credit Insurance Policy is specifically designed for small, financially viable businesses that are new to exporting, or have only occasionally exported. It can help increase an exporter's international sales by extending competitive credit terms while minimizing risks. 
 The Multi-Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policy enables U.S. exporters to reduce their risk of selling on credit terms by insuring their export accounts receivable against default or non-payment. The policy can help increase international sales by extending competitive credit terms to foreign buyers while minimizing risks. 
 The Short-Term Single-Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policy allows exporters to insure specific, short-term foreign receivables against loss due to commercial and specified political risks on a selective basis. 
 Ex-Im Bank offers U.S. leasers the opportunity to expand their overseas leasing programs by providing comprehensive insurance for both the stream of lease payments and the fair market value of the leased products.
