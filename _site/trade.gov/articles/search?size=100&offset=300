This rule will reduce emissions of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP), including mercury, from the electric power industry. As a co-benefit, the emissions of certain PM2.5 precursors such as SO2 will also decline. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that this final rule will yield annual monetized benefits (in 2007$) of between $37 to $90 billion using a 3% discount rate and $33 to $81 billion using a 7% discount rate. The great majority of the estimates are attributable to co-benefits from 4,200 to 11,000 fewer PM2.5-related premature mortalities. \r\n U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Background \r\n U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Research and Analysis \r\n Environmental Solution and U.S. Solution Providers \r\n Acid Gases -- Dry Sorbent Injection \r\n  ADA-ES \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Acid Gases -- Dry Sorbent Injection with Electrostatic Precipitators \r\n  ADA-ES \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Acid Gases -- Dry Sorbent Injection with Fabric Filters or Electrostatic Precipitators \r\n  ADA-ES \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Marsulex Environmental Technologies \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Acid Gases -- Flue-gas Desulfurization \r\n  Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Marsulex Environmental Technologies \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Dioxins \u0026amp; Furans -- Work Practice Standard (inspection, adjustment, and/or maintenance and repairs to ensure optimal combustion) \r\n  Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Mercury -- Activated Carbon Injection \r\n  ADA-ES \r\n ADA-CS \r\n Albemarle \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n BASF \r\n Norit Americas \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Tekran Instruments Corp \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n Unitherm \r\n  Mercury -- Activated Carbon Injection with Fabric Filter \r\n  ADA-ES \r\n ADA-CS \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n BASF \r\n Norit Americas \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Tekran Instruments Corp \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n Unitherm \r\n  Mercury -- Flue-gas Desulfurization \r\n  ADA-CS \r\n Alstom Power, Inc. \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n MAR Systems \r\n Marsulex Environmental Technologies \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Tekran Instruments Corp \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n Unitherm \r\n  Mercury -- Selective Catalytic Reduction  \r\n  ADA-CS \r\n Alstom Power, Inc. \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Cormetech \r\n Johnson Matthey \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Tekran Instruments Corp \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Non-Mercury Metals -- Fabric Filter, Electrostatic Precipitators \r\n  Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Sulphur Dioxide -- Flue-gas Desulphurization \r\n  Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Marsulex Environmental Technologies \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Sulphur Dioxide -- Dry Sorbent Injection \r\n  ADA-ES \r\n Andover Technology Partners \r\n Babcock Wilcox \r\n Marsulex Environmental Technologies \r\n Siemens Energy, Inc. \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n  Other Applicable Technologies \r\n  Dais Analytic Corporation \r\n Nalco, an Ecolab Company \r\n Novinda Corporation \r\n Thermo Scientific \r\n W.L.

Please note that the FTC updated the Safe Harbor material on its own website in late 2012 to include detailed information regarding such enforcement. \r\n New Survey Feature Launched in June 2012:  Organizations participating in the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor programs will be invited to complete a new survey to help ITA’s Office of Technology and Electronic Commerce better evaluate the programs and how they support U.S. exports.  The survey consists of five short questions and should only take a few minutes to complete.  Those organizations self-certifying for the first time or recertifying on-line will be prompted to complete the survey prior to arriving at the payment page.  We hope that organizations participating in one or both of the Safe Harbor programs will take this important opportunity to communicate directly with ITA regarding the programs to help us better serve the Safe Harbor community. \r\n New Safe Harbor List Search Function Launched in June 2012:  In an effort to further enhance the functionality of the Safe Harbor website (export.gov/safeharbor), ITA’s Office of Technology and Electronic Commerce launched a new search function making the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Lists searchable by organization certification status (i.e. “Current” or “Not Current”).  We hope that this enhancement will make the Safe Harbor Lists and the Safe Harbor website even more useful to all Safe Harbor stakeholders. \r\n U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Cooperation \r\n U.S. Commerce General Counsel Cameron Kerry Editorial Avoiding a Data Divide Between the U.S. and the EU \r\n November 22, 2012, European Voice, Brussels, Belgium \r\n General Counsel Kerry writes, “In the United States, our hope is that a global framework for national privacy policies will emerge that protects consumers, encourages innovation, and supports trade and economic growth. Both the US and the EU must take care to preserve the free flow of data that supports one of the most significant trade relationships in the world.”  The editorial cites the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as a flexible mechanism that enables the kind of international privacy policy interoperability called for in President Obama’s comprehensive privacy blueprint.  The editorial highlights the benefits of the Framework to businesses, consumers, and transatlantic trade and notes that “the value of this mechanism cannot be overstated.”  \r\n \r\n   The full text of the editorial is available via the link provided above. \r\n  \r\n U.S.-EU Joint Statement on Privacy from EU Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding and U.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson \r\n March 19, 2012, Washington, DC \r\n “In line with the objectives of increasing trade and regulatory cooperation outlined by our leaders at the U.S.-EU Summit, the United States and the European Union reaffirm their respective commitments to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. This Framework, which has been in place since 2000, is a useful starting point for further interoperability. Since its inception, over 3,000 companies have self-certified to the Framework to demonstrate their commitment to privacy protection and to facilitate transatlantic trade. The European Commission and the Department of Commerce look forward to continued close U.S.-EU collaboration to ensure the continued operation and progressive updates to this Framework. As the EU and the United States continue to work on significant revisions to their respective privacy frameworks over the next several years, the two sides will endeavor to find mechanisms that will foster the free flow of data across the Atlantic. Both parties are committed to work towards solutions based on non-discrimination and mutual recognition when it comes to personal data protection issues which could serve as frameworks for global interoperability that can promote innovation, the free flow of goods and services, and privacy protection around the world.

The United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation. Switzerland, however, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of an independent government data protection agency, registration of databases with this agency, and in some instances prior approval before personal data processing may begin. As a result of these differences, the FADP could have significantly hampered the ability of U.S. organizations to engage in a range of trans-Atlantic transactions. \r\n In order to bridge these differences and provide a streamlined and cost-effective means for U.S. organizations to satisfy the FADP’s “adequacy” requirement, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland developed a \"safe harbor\" framework. The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was approved by Switzerland in 2009, is an important way for U.S. organizations to avoid experiencing interruptions in their business dealings with Switzerland or facing prosecution by Swiss authorities under Swiss privacy law. Self-certifying to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework will ensure that Swiss organizations know that your organization provides \"adequate\" privacy protection, as defined by Swiss law. \r\n   \r\n Please note that the form used for self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework is identical to that used for self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework; nevertheless, an organization is not required to self-certify to one of the Safe Harbor Frameworks in order to self-certify to the other. Organizations should also note that when they select “Switzerland” as a country from which they receive personal data, they are self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. It is critically important that an organization read the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, 15 FAQs, and enforcement documents before submitting a self-certification form. \r\n Checklist for Joining the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor: \r\n If your organization is considering joining: \r\n \r\n   Read the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Overview.  \r\n  Read the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework Documents.  \r\n  Review the Helpful Hints on Self-Certifying Compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.  \r\n  Review the Safe Harbor Workbook.  \r\n  \r\n If your organization decides to join: \r\n \r\n   Bring your organization's policies and practices into compliance with the requirements outlined in Helpful Hints on Self-Certifying Compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.  \r\n  Review the Information Required for Self-Certification.  \r\n  Complete and submit the Certification Form \r\n  \r\n Upon receipt of your organization’s self-certification submission and corresponding processing fee, the submission will be reviewed for completeness. If and when the submission is deemed complete, it will be posted to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor List, available on this website.

Please note that the FTC updated the Safe Harbor material on its own website in late 2012 to include detailed information regarding such enforcement. \r\n New Survey Feature Launched in June 2012:  Organizations participating in the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor programs will be invited to complete a new survey to help ITA’s Office of Technology and Electronic Commerce better evaluate the programs and how they support U.S. exports.  The survey consists of five short questions and should only take a few minutes to complete.  Those organizations self-certifying for the first time or recertifying on-line will be prompted to complete the survey prior to arriving at the payment page.  We hope that organizations participating in one or both of the Safe Harbor programs will take this important opportunity to communicate directly with ITA regarding the programs to help us better serve the Safe Harbor community. \r\n New Safe Harbor List Search Function Launched in June 2012:  In an effort to further enhance the functionality of the Safe Harbor website (export.gov/safeharbor), ITA’s Office of Technology and Electronic Commerce launched a new search function making the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Lists searchable by organization certification status (i.e. “Current” or “Not Current”).  We hope that this enhancement will make the Safe Harbor Lists and the Safe Harbor website even more useful to all Safe Harbor stakeholders. \r\n U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Cooperation \r\n U.S. Commerce General Counsel Cameron Kerry Editorial Avoiding a Data Divide Between the U.S. and the EU \r\n November 22, 2012, European Voice, Brussels, Belgium \r\n General Counsel Kerry writes, “In the United States, our hope is that a global framework for national privacy policies will emerge that protects consumers, encourages innovation, and supports trade and economic growth. Both the US and the EU must take care to preserve the free flow of data that supports one of the most significant trade relationships in the world.”  The editorial cites the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as a flexible mechanism that enables the kind of international privacy policy interoperability called for in President Obama’s comprehensive privacy blueprint.  The editorial highlights the benefits of the Framework to businesses, consumers, and transatlantic trade and notes that “the value of this mechanism cannot be overstated.”  \r\n \r\n  The full text of the editorial is available via the link provided above. \r\n  \r\n U.S.-EU Joint Statement on Privacy from EU Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding and U.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson \r\n March 19, 2012, Washington, DC \r\n “In line with the objectives of increasing trade and regulatory cooperation outlined by our leaders at the U.S.-EU Summit, the United States and the European Union reaffirm their respective commitments to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. This Framework, which has been in place since 2000, is a useful starting point for further interoperability. Since its inception, over 3,000 companies have self-certified to the Framework to demonstrate their commitment to privacy protection and to facilitate transatlantic trade. The European Commission and the Department of Commerce look forward to continued close U.S.-EU collaboration to ensure the continued operation and progressive updates to this Framework.

Advocacy assistance is wide and varied but often involves companies that must communicate a message to foreign governments or government-owned corporations. \r\n The following is a brief synopsis of the commercial and defense advocacy process and what you need to know to put U.S. Government resources and authority behind your company in foreign project or procurement competitions. \r\n The Advocacy Application Process Advocacy Center Services Why We Advocate Value-added to U.S. Firms Outside the Center's Scope of Work Contract Signings \r\n The Advocacy Application Process \r\n The Advocacy Center grants U.S. Government (USG) advocacy assistance on a case-by-case basis in response to requests made by firms pursuing foreign government procurements and/or projects. \r\n Note: Before applying for a U.S. government advocacy support, please speak with an Advocacy Center staff member prior to filing a questionnaire. \r\n  Companies seeking USG support in specific commercial and defense competitions must submit completed advocacy questionnairesto the Advocacy Center for review.\r\n  The questionnaire must be signed by an officer of the filing company. \r\n In cases involving joint-ventures, consortia and teaming arrangements, the documents must be cosigned by an officer of the Bidder-of-Record. \r\n Lastly, the submitted advocacy questionnaires must be accompanied by a completed and signed agreement concerning bribery. \r\n  \r\n Together with the U.S. Embassy and relevant USG agencies, the Advocacy Center will conduct due diligence on the requesting company, bid/project and the competition. \r\n On a case-by-case basis for commercial transactions, following the due diligence process, the Advocacy Center and, if necessary, the USG Advocacy Network will make a national interest determination to identify whether the project qualifies for USG support. Typically, companies must demonstrate how supporting their bid will positively benefit the U.S. economy, primarily in the form of exports of goods and services. (Yet other factors may also be taken into consideration. Please see the Advocacy Guidelines for a list of these factors.) \r\n The Advocacy Center is the initial point-of-contact for companies requesting USG advocacy for sales of defense-related goods and services. After initial review and due diligence, the Advocacy Center refers defense advocacy cases to the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) for interagency review and a national interest determination. Once the determination is made, the Advocacy Center will take the lead in coordinating advocacy for the company. \r\n  Advocacy Center Services \r\n Once a company's request has been qualified for USG advocacy assistance, the Advocacy Center will work with relevant agencies to devise an appropriate advocacy strategy. \r\n  USG advocacy ranges from U.S. Embassy and Consulate assistance to Sub-Cabinet and Cabinet messages delivered through a variety of media (e.g., letters, phone calls, or face-to-face meetings). \r\n Typically, the Advocacy Center, working in unison with the company, plays a prominent role in coordinating both the message and the medium. \r\n The Advocacy Center also works with Ex-Im Bank, the Trade and Development Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to marshal USG financial support, where appropriate, to relevant and qualified U.S. companies. \r\n  Why We Advocate \r\n These are the principal reasons why the USG provides advocacy services to U.S. firms in foreign government project or procurement competitions. \r\n  USG advocacy assistance promotes U.S. exports, supports U.S. employment and increases global market share for U.S. businesses. \r\n In many cases, USG advocacy counters foreign government advocacy and political pressure, thus \"leveling the playing field\" for U.S. companies. \r\n USG advocacy encourages transparency, promotes fair treatment of U.S. companies and addresses bribery and corruption in tender processes. \r\n  Value-added to U.S. Firms \r\n There are a number of services the Advocacy Center provides which offer a competitive advantage to U.S. companies competing in foreign competitions. \r\n  Within the large U.S. Government bureaucracy, the Advocacy Center centralizes commercial advocacy services in one office. \r\n The Center offers an ability to mobilize resources in support of U.S. company proposals and business opportunities. \r\n The Center also offers institutionalized process to support of the U.S. national interest, creating and retaining US jobs and expanding the U.S. export base. \r\n  Outside the Center's Scope of Work \r\n There are certain company requests that fall outside the Advocacy Center's scope of work. \r\n  The Advocacy Center is focused almost exclusively on foreign business opportunities which involve foreign government decision-makers and does not typically become involved in private sector commercial transactions. \r\n The Advocacy Center’s focus is on specific commercial or defense transactions, not policy advocacy. There are other offices in the International Trade Administration that handle policy-related or market access and trade compliance advocacy assistance. \r\n  Contract Signings \r\n Companies participating in Commerce-sponsored trade missions and events can request the attendance of Department officials at contract signings associated with these activities. To make this request, the company must complete the trade events form (pdf) and submit it to the Advocacy Center. The completed and signed trade events form may be faxed back to the Advocacy Center at (202) 482-3508. \r\n Note: When your company or any U.S. firm submits a trade events form to the Advocacy Center, the information in the document is considered business confidential and will not be shared with any person or organization outside the U.S. Government unless the Advocacy Center is given permission to do so by your company.

Manufacturers in the European Union (EU) and abroad must meet CE marking requirements where applicable in order to market their products in Europe. For a list of countries that require the CE marking, see: CE Marking Countries. A manufacturer who has gone through the conformity assessment process, may affix the CE marking to the product. With the CE marking, the product may be marketed throughout the EU. CE marking now provides product access to 27 countries with a population of nearly 500 million. \r\n Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive list of the products that require a CE marking. Therefore, it is the manufacturer's responsibility to determine if a product requires a CE marking. The \"New Approach Directives\" are documents that contain the legislation issued by the European Commission on the requirements that need to be met and procedures that must be followed in order for a particular product to be CE marked for sales in the EU. \r\n In order to determine if your product needs a CE marking, you should look in each directive that you judge as related to your product. Our Guide to navigating the CE marking process is organized by directives: CE Marking Guide. Under each directive, we explain the route to CE marking certification step-by-step and in one place. \r\n Some products require conformance to more than one directive. For example, the Safety of Machinery directive, the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) directive, and the Low Voltage Equipment directive may all apply to one product. \r\n Many of the CE marking directives allow manufacturers to self-certify their products. \r\n Some examples for which manufacturers can self-certify include: · Safety of Machinery Directive · Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive · Low Voltage Directive · Class I products of the Medical Device Directive · Most products covered by the Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R\u0026amp;TTE) Directive \r\n Some examples of the directives that do not allow manufacturers to self-certify include: · Simple Pressure Vessels Directive · Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels Directive · Most products covered by the Pressure Equipment Directive · Most products covered by the Equipment and Protective Systems in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres Directive \r\n If you are not permitted to self-certify your product, you will need to employ the services of a testing laboratory that is affiliated with a \"European Notified Body\" to test and certify your product for the CE marking. There are labs in the U.S. that subcontract for European notified bodies and are qualified to do the testing and certifying. We have provided a list of labs, including labs affiliated with notified bodies as well as labs that are not authorized with a notified body, but which are independent labs and can test that a product covered by a non-regulated directive (such as the EMC or Low Voltage Directives), has met a European standard: Testing/Certifying Labs. \r\n If you are permitted to self-certify your product, you may need to order the standards that apply to your product, particularly in the case of the Low Voltage and EMC Directives. We have provided sources for ordering standards and for locating CE Marking consultancy services: Consultants/Ordering Standards. \r\n Once the manufacturer has conformed to the requirements laid out in the applicable directive(s), whether through self-certification or approval by a notified body, and has obtained a certificate/report from a lab to prove conformance, the manufacturer needs to affix the CE marking to its product. The manufacturer must also include a \"declaration of conformity\" with each shipment stating which CE marking directive(s) has been met and include a signature of a company official indicating the company's responsibility for its CE marking compliance claim. We have provided an example of a declaration of conformity: Declaration of Conformity. \r\n The exporter must maintain a file called a \"technical file\" containing the paperwork that proves conformity to the CE marking directive(s) covering its product. The exporter or authorized representative must be able to provide the supporting paperwork to prove CE marking conformity at any time, if requested by the appropriate member state authorities. See:Technical File Procedures for a framework for compiling a technical file. \r\n Finally, it is the manufacturer/exporter's responsibility to regularly check for and comply with any standards changes that might affect its product. Therefore, it is important to periodically visit the EU website http://www.newapproach.org that lists the CE marking directives and their standards. \r\n For additional information on the CE marking process, see the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication \"TO U.S. MANUFACTURERS: ALERT PRODUCT \"MARK\" REQUIRED FOR U.S. EXPORTS TO EUROPE!\" ","pub_date":"2013-03-26","title":"Program Overview","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":true,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"394","content":" U.S. Government Advocacy Guidelines   (Printer-friendly Adobe.pdf document) \r\n Ahora, las directrices están disponibles en español \r\n Purpose  \r\n The goal of U.S. Government (USG) advocacy assistance is to expand U.S. exports and export-related employment as a means to promote U.S. economic health and well-being. The following advocacy guidelines are to assist USG personnel in determining whether and to what extent USG support is appropriate in connection with a transaction involving U.S. interests. \r\n Background Information \r\n USG officials, particularly in our embassies abroad, frequently approach foreign governments on behalf of U.S. commercial interests. In this connection, however, they are often faced with requests to intervene in support of private parties to proposed transactions in which there is some question as to the degree and nature of U.S. participation and/or interest. \r\n USG export promotion policy has historically looked to U.S. incorporation and U.S. export content in determining whether USG support is appropriate in a particular instance. The increasingly complex nature of international commercial transactions now necessitates revisiting the issue of which factors should be considered in determining whether or not to provide USG advocacy support in any given circumstance. The guidelines that follow are provided to ambassadors and embassy commercial personnel for the purpose of assisting in these determinations on a case-by-case basis. \r\n The issues that arise with respect to any individual transaction may include, for example: determining whether to support any bid in which the goods or services to be delivered do not contain the traditional U.S. export content level of more than 50 percent; determining whether to support a bid by a foreign-owned, U.S.-incorporated firm that may or may not contain more than 50 percent U.S. export content; differentiating between or among bids by more than one U.S. firm, bids by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms, and bids by various consortia where differences in the degree of U.S. participation and viability of the bid may or may not be significant. The guidelines below place a premium on U.S. export content, including employment, in the determination of whether and to what extent a given bid is to be considered in the U.S. national interest. While any bid meeting the 50 percent U.S. export content threshold is presumed to be in the national interest, bids with lesser U.S. export content may, under certain circumstances, also be determined to be deserving of comparable, nondiscriminatory treatment by the USG. Conversely, USG support for a bid may not be in the national interest — even if the bid contains greater than 50 percent U.S. content — if, for example, the bidding firm’s home market is closed to U.S. firms. \r\n Obviously, no guidelines can address dispositively all possible fact situations likely to be faced by posts abroad. Therefore, in particularly complex cases, consultations with interested Washington agencies may be required before a determination can be reached. \r\n Eligibility for USG Advocacy \r\n WE STRONGLY URGE COMPANIES INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT ADVOCACY SUPPORT TO SPEAK WITH AN ADVOCACY CENTER STAFF MEMBER PRIOR TO FILING AN ADVOCACY QUESTIONNAIRE. PLEASE CLICK ON “STAFF DIRECTORY” TO SEE A LIST OF ADVOCACY CENTER MANAGEMENT AND STAFF. \r\n 1. The overall basis for determining the nature and extent of USG support for a viable bid or proposal in connection with an international transaction shall be the U.S. national interest. A U.S. national interest determination will first weigh and assess the foreseeable, material benefits to the U.S. economy that may potentially be derived from a transaction and assess the merit of a request for USG support of any bid or proposal made in connection with the transaction. \r\n 2. A bid or proposal in which the U.S. content of the goods or services to be provided exceeds 50 percent of the total value (including material, equipment and labor) shall be presumed to be in the U.S. national interest. \r\n 3. In cases where the U.S. content does not exceed 50 percent, the following factors, often associated with U.S. ownership, may be considered in determining whether USG support of a bid or proposal is in the U.S. national interest: \r\n \r\n   U.S. materials and equipment content;  \r\n  U.S. labor content;  \r\n  Contribution to the U.S. technology base, including conduct of research and development in the U.S.;  \r\n  Repatriation of profits to the U.S. economy; and  \r\n  Potential for follow-on business that would benefit the U.S. economy. \r\n  \r\n The USG may determine that a bid or proposal that meets one or more of the above factors in a clear and substantial way is in the U.S. national interest. \r\n 4. All bids or proposals that are determined to be in the U.S. national interest under paragraphs 2 or 3 above shall be supported by the USG in an equal, nondiscriminatory manner, except in the case of foreign and foreign-controlled bidders. In these instances, the USG may take into account, with respect to the relevant product or service, the absence of competitive opportunities for U.S. firms in the bidder’s home market that are substantially equivalent to those available in the U.S. market for like products or services, as reflected in National Trade Estimate Reports on Foreign Trade Barriers prepared by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. \r\n 5. It shall be the responsibility of the firm or entity seeking USG support to advise the post in a timely manner of its interest. Firms should be prepared to substantiate to the satisfaction of the post the applicability of the above criteria, with documentation (when necessary and appropriate). Firms may be informed that their failure to provide such information in a timely manner may preclude USG support. \r\n 6. A firm seeking USG support must agree that it and its affiliates: \r\n A. have not and will not engage in the bribery of foreign officials in connection with the matter for which advocacy assistance is being sought; and \r\n B. maintain and enforce a policy that prohibits the bribery of foreign officials. \r\n The firm must further acknowledge that failure to comply with the terms of the agreement may result in the denial of advocacy assistance. \r\n 7. In complex or sensitive transactions (including those specifically referred to in the fourth paragraph), the post should consult with interested Washington agencies for advice on a case-by-case basis.

This is the equivalent to 1,715,000Kwh (based on 5,000,000Kwh) total consumption year on year. In addition, newly-installed Honeywell technology is designed to monitor and help yield an additional annual savings of 3% a year on electricity.  Finally, Embassy Stockholm converted from fossil fuel to district heating, and has saved 1240 tons of C02e. This aggressive program has already met Embassy Stockholm’s share of the Administration’s goal of 20% reduction of C02e before 2020.   \r\n Geo-Thermal \r\n In March of 2011, the Chief of Mission residence was converted to geo-thermal for both space and hot-water heating. This followed a successful conversion of two residences to geo-thermal heating. While the new systems have not been tested during the up-coming winter, Embassy Sweden has already experienced substantial savings: FY2010 to FY 2011 period-to-period comparison reveals a 57% savings in natural gas usage. \r\n Honeywell Metering \r\n In a partnership with Honeywell SBS Sweden, the Embassy has installed an 11 METER HUB for capturing electrical, heating, and water usage in real time, the first Embassy to use this technology.  At the heart of the technology is Honeywell’s state-of-the-art Energy Manager Module.   This software program captures input from all meters in real-time, producing a comprehensive report as output.  The tool will enable Embassy management to make informed decisions regarding where best to apply energy savings measures.  The installation of the metering system will for the first time enable Embassy Stockholm to monitor its energy usage.  Capturing this data will facilitate the implementation of energy savings measures whose economic payback will be quantified and justified.  Embassy Stockholm is the first Embassy to use this technology. \r\n BetaLED lighting \r\n Embassy Sweden installed Beta LED LEDway Road 40LED street lights with road optic and 3500K color temperature on Gärdesgatan. The lights use 47W annual energy consumption per fixture, 205kWh product life cycle, and last about 20 years. BetaLED lights do not contain mercury, while traditional high pressure sodium or mercury light source has a 70W HPS lamp with 84W annual energy consumption per fixture and a 367kWh product life cycle (lamp), which needs to be replaced every 4 years.  The new BetaLED energy savings are between 40%-65% and the maintenance interval is a long period of 20-25 years. The BetaLED product can be serviced and upgraded so the real lifetime of the product can be even longer. In addition, the product is built partly from recycled material. \r\n GE/Skanska technologies \r\n The Embassy’s Building Management and Commerce offices pulled together a GE/Skanska partnership for energy controls, technologies and cost savings. The partnership allowed the Embassy to showcase new GE technology for improving energy efficiency installing GE’s HabiTEQ™ energy automation system. HabiTEQ™ is an automated heating, lighting, and ventilation system, and is controlled by touch or computer, reducing energy by up to 13% on lighting and up to 20% on heating. The system was installed as part of the refurbishment of Embassy Stockholm’s visitors' conference and dining hall. \r\n EV Showcase \r\n Embassy Stockholm also featured US-made electric vehicles at the Embassy on road rallies, large events, Road Shows, and through our Swedish American Green Alliance network of cleantech companies. This work has contributed to an increase exports in Sweden for these U.S. vehicle companies.  U.S. Embassy Stockholm continues to be a unique showplace for U.S. cleantech energy efficiency technology for reaching targets for USG buildings, and equally important, for increasing U.S. cleantech exports under the President’s National Export Initiative (NEI). \r\n The League of Green Embassies, The Origins \r\n The League was begun late in Ambassador Michael Wood’s posting at Embassy Stockholm in conjunction with the installation of district heating for the Embassy, ensuring that residences and chancery were using green energy (Green Certificates).  District heating plants provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers in the cold north. Also, 90% percent of the energy in Swedish district heating system is usually produced with renewable sources. Ambassador Wood initially contacted other U.S. embassies and encouraged them to share their best greening practices on a share point site created for this purpose and named League of Green Embassies. \r\n Then followed EU-wide promotion and communications from Embassy Stockholm Management and Commerce offices with other interested parties in Europe, as well as few embassies outside. The League’s stature was elevated in importance with President Obama’s program for reducing energy consumption in USG buildings. The Overseas Building Operations (OBO) group at the Department of State visited several embassies in Europe during this time, and a special networking session hosted by CS Paris between OBO, Embassy Management Officers, SCOs, and six engaged Ambassadors, including Ambassador Barzun, who chaired the League of Green Embassies at this time.  US Ambassador to Finland Bruce Oreck took over the Chairmanship in 2009. A Platinum Key Service was added to boost US company participation in the League and the National Export Initiative. \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-04-08","title":"EMBASSY SWEDEN: Green Retrofits","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Energy \u0026 Mining"],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"428","content":" Advocacy Questionnaire and the Anti-Bribery Agreement \r\n A company interested in receiving U.S. Government advocacy assistance must first file an Advocacy Questionnaire and Anti-Bribery Agreement (pdf) with the Advocacy Center.

It was clear that for the program to achieve its goals of reducing operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency, all Embassy staff—officers, managers, foreign service nationals-- would have to be involved. In addition, LEAF is a multi-agency effort, with the U.S. Commercial Service collaborating closely with the State Department and others to promote change, working to reduce the carbon footprint of embassy buildings, and advising the Ambassador on how to achieve that goal. Mr. Victor Madeira, a local employee provides continuity for the multi-year program, is a highly active participant in the process. U.S. Ambassador Thomas Stephenson, and now U.S. Ambassador Allen Katz are both fully committed to the effort. \r\n As one of its first steps, LEAF went out to all embassy staff asking for suggestions and exciting interest in the program. LEAF received over 100 ideas in this way. Each recommendation is vetted for cost and benefit. Then a plan was created to capture the low-hanging fruit of the eco-efficiency program. The embassy: created additional spaces for car-pooling cars; switched from incandescent to compact florescent bulbs; installed power strips for computers and other appliances and motion sensors for automatic operation of lights in the buildings. Fourteen of the 25 recommendations that had been made in a 1997 energy audit were implemented, and the rest were reviewed. A new audit was requested. \r\n By 2008, the LEAF team, consisting of 8-10 dedicated members, was able to expand the program. They arranged for the Embassy, which in that budget cycle needed to replace equipment, to make greener procurement choices. The Embassy upgraded the vehicles in its motor pool, to clean diesel—which uses ultra-low sulfur diesel, or ULSD, and reduced the number of vehicles in the fleet; retrofitted its HVAC system with MagLevTM (Magnetic Levitation) technology; installed a humidity sensor to control lawn watering; purchased energy star appliances; and installed a new boiler that is 50% more efficient than the old one. The Green Team of State’s Overseas Building Operations assisted with some of the retrofits. The LEAF team overhauled the existing recycling program, increasing the number of receptacles, and arranging for the contractor to better segregate recycled items (at no additional cost). \r\n By 2010, energy, water and fuel use in embassy properties and on embassy grounds have measurably and predictably improved: \r\n \r\n  Reduced electricity consumption by 15% \r\n Reduced diesel fuel consumption for heating by 27% \r\n Reduced water consumption by 16% \r\n Reduced kilometers driven by 22% \r\n Reduced carbon foot print by approximately 230 tons (CO2eq). \r\n Saved approximately $50,000 \r\n  \r\n Makeover Event \r\n On December 7, Ambassador Katz hosted a reception for inaugurating the installation of new technologies from 3M, Phillips, Whirlpool, and Belkin. \r\n The League of Green Embassies is a USG initiative promoting energy efficiency in the green building sector by retrofitting U.S. embassies with the most efficient technologies. Embassies are a powerful force for introducing innovative solutions, influencing individuals and institutions in host countries, and play an important role in mobilizing public opinion and action. The vision of the League, a collaboration of the departments of State and Commerce, is to stimulate economic growth, promote green building exports by demonstrating the effectiveness of U.S. technologies, and stimulate U.S. investment in clean energy and environmental technologies, while addressing energy security. The League reflects the commitment of its 70 members to reduce operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions of embassies and related properties. Membership is open to foreign embassies. The League was established in 2007 by Michael M. Wood, former U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. \r\n Since November 2010, the League has been chaired by Ambassador Bruce J. Oreck, U.S. Ambassador to Finland. Fourteen U.S. companies working in the green building space have signed up for a Platinum Key Service. In March of 2011, League activity centered on a “makeover” of the residence of Ambassador Howard Guttman. His residence is the oldest U.S. property among the embassies, and now a forward sales platform for U.S. technologies and products. During the next weeks and months, eleven Chief of Mission residences will be undergoing similar makeovers.

The “client,” who writes the tender for the ESCO is not the Government, but the real estate developer. A document providing Guidance and Advice on setting up and delivering on an ESCO contract was published in 2007, but still provides a good overview of some of the projects established in the UK, highlighting the support that ESCOs may receive by central and local government. See also the main UK ESCO blog for updates. \r\n Commercial Service Market Research \r\n The Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency Scheme is a mandatory scheme introduced by the UK Government in 2010 aimed at improving energy efficiency and cutting emissions in large public and private sector organizations. The scheme is one of the main drivers implementing energy efficient services, including ESCOs. \r\n Large organizations are responsible for around 10% of the UK’s emissions. The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme scheme features a range of reputational, behavioral and financial drivers, which aim to encourage organizations to develop energy management strategies that promote a better understanding of energy usage. \r\n The UK Government has been very supportive of ESCO implementation and the UK ESCO market is now quite mature and competitive. \r\n Many UK energy efficiency projects involve creating an ESCO via a tender process. Various councils in the UK have set up ESCOs in one way or another to provide heat and power in the form of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) to local housing estates in order to tackle fuel poverty. Other ventures with ESCOs have also been driven by concern for the climatic effect of energy usage. A few authorities have teamed up with existing ESCOs, and there are also examples of private sector developer-driven ESCOs. \r\n The ownership/governance of ESCOs in the UK essentially falls into one of three categories: \r\n 1. Wholly owned by the private sector, for instance, an ESCO in which the shares are held by an energy provider and a developer (there are a number of these planned or in operation). Local authority powers are not relevant at all to an ESCO of this kind although the energy regulatory matters do of course apply; \r\n 2. ESCOs in which a local authority has an interest, but where that interest is less than 20%. Normally the remaining 81% would be held by one or more private sector interests, usually an energy provider. Limiting local authority participation to below 20% prevents the ESCO being consolidated with local authority constraints and duties (finance rules; and other complications and constraints). The joint venture agreement with the private sector party can specify the function and objectives of the ESCO, its funding, the choice of projects and other matters, regardless of the local authority’s minority shareholding. \r\n 3. An ESCO in which the local authority has a 20% or greater shareholding. These are most suitable where the ESCO’s function is focused upon matters of social, economic or environmental well being, and where commercial considerations of making a profit are secondary. This could occur for example, where the scheme operated by the ESCO is not commercially viable as a free standing business and significant financial support is required of the local authority. In that case, local authority powers do require close attention and may constrain the ESCO’s activities (e.g. selling electricity other than to consumers of the scheme). These types of schemes do not necessarily pre-suppose no profitable private sector involvement - in some cases, a local authority may wish, for social, economic or environmental reasons, to have a shareholding of greater than 20%, but nevertheless can still offer involvement in a scheme to a private sector partner on terms which are commercially viable for that partner \r\n There are numerous ESCOs active in the UK – these include utilities (e.g. EoN, EdF, Scottish Power), CHP manufacturers (e.g. Dalkia, Cogenco) and other energy suppliers such as Thameswey Energy: \r\n \r\n  Alpheon Energy \r\n Cantium Energy \r\n Cofely (GDF Suez - formerly Cofathec and Elyo) \r\n Cogenco \r\n Dalkia (Mitie) \r\n EdF \r\n E.ON Energy Services \r\n ENER-G \r\n Fontenergy \r\n Galliford Try \r\n Greenrock \r\n GSH Group \r\n Honeywell \r\n Johnson Controls \r\n Lorne Stewart \r\n Maicon \r\n MCL Energy \r\n Norland \r\n Schneider Electric \r\n Scottish Power \r\n Self Energy UK \r\n Thameswey Energy \r\n Utilicom (bought by Cofely / GDF, from Idex) \r\n Vital Energi \r\n  \r\n ESCO contracts can vary widely. They are more common in some sectors where an organization effectively ‘contracts out’ its entire energy facilities. An example of this would be the provision of energy services to a hospital under a Public Private Partnership (PPP) contract. \r\n In some instances, the ESCO contractor will design, install, finance, operate and maintain a CHP plant on the organization’s site. In other cases, the organization subcontracts only the operation and maintenance of power plant that has been installed by other contractors under a capital purchase arrangement. In both cases, the ESCO contractor supplies heat and power to the organization at agreed rates. The ESCO contractor will also normally take responsibility for fuel purchase, for other on-site energy plant and for the purchase of conventional energy. \r\n From a financing point of view, the basis of an agreement of this type is the transfer of power plant capital and operating costs, together with all the technical and operating risks of the plant, from the end user to the ESCO contractor. \r\n Different ESCO contractors may produce widely differing proposals, depending on the organization’s requirements and the ESCO contractor’s objectives. Among the many variables to be resolved will be: \r\n \r\n  Who will operate the plant on a day-to-day basis and, therefore, bear the performance risk? \r\n Who will maintain the plant? \r\n Who will own the plant at the end of the initial agreement period of 10-15 years and at what ongoing cost? \r\n  \r\n Any transaction with an ESCO contractor involves a long-term commitment by the organization. The organization’s audited accounts should contain a summary of this commitment. Evidence will also be needed to satisfy the organization’s auditors that the arrangement is an operating lease and not a finance lease. If ownership transfer to the organization is implied or stated in the contract, the arrangement must appear on the organization’s balance sheet. \r\n It should also be noted that an ESCO contract and finance are not intrinsically linked. It is possible to enjoy the core benefits of an ESCO arrangement – cost reduction and operational risk transfer – irrespective of the finance route chosen. \r\n Opportunities available in the UK market typically fall into one of the three following categories: \r\n 1. Opportunities specific to the facilities management model – However public procurement is currently limited, e.g. the Private Finance Initiative has a poor record on energy performance contracting; \r\n 2. Opportunities specific to the community model: \r\n \r\n  Key sectors such as local government or social housing have taken the lead; \r\n Housing developers could contract out all energy infrastructure on a site to an ESCO to design build operate maintain and bill. The ESCO can design and manage the assets to achieve least life cycle costs \r\n In new build developments, the cost of energy efficiency and microgeneration is the marginal cost over and above what would be installed anyway (e.g. gas boilers, gas network). Economies of scale can be made to install devices in a thousand homes in one go. Systems (e.g. metering and generation systems) can be integrated from the start; \r\n In new build developments, an electrical network has to be installed to each home, which is usually given to the distribution network operator (DNO) to manage because it is seen as a liability. If this is designed and installed by an ESCO it can be retained and used to sell surplus electricity by private wire. \r\n  \r\n An example of the significant support that the local UK Planning Authorities are giving to the implementation of ESCOs in new major regeneration schemes is all major new-build developments in London now being required to include for decentralized energy district schemes (unless proved unfeasible through a detailed technical study). \r\n 3. Opportunities specific to the domestic energy supplier model – Schemes established under the community model could take a lead in connecting homes close to the core community. In the UK, district heating schemes grow their connected load at an estimated 5% per annum once established. \r\n Multi Utility Service Companies (MUSCOs) \r\n MUSCOs are recently taking the lead on utility provision for large-scale sustainable developments. MUSCOs have a remit stretching far beyond the energy arena to also offer developers water, wastewater and communications services. \r\n The MUSCO market has been emerging over the past four or five years, and would have been more developed were it not for the recession and its disastrous effect on house-building. But a significant number of sustainable development projects remain in the offing, particularly surrounding London regeneration. \r\n Additional information includes assistance to companies wishing to deploy energy efficiency; a link to the ESCO EU 2012 Conference; and a report by the European Commission on energy efficiency and the market for ESCOs. \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-04-08","title":"United Kingdom - Energy Efficiency Markets","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Energy \u0026 Mining"],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"434","content":" News Updates \r\n During the months of November and December, six Europe EE Sweep events have taken place.

As the Associated Press reported in April: \r\n “Enormous 18th-century houses aren’t known as the most energy-efficient buildings in the world. But now the 230-year-old residence of the U.S. ambassador to Belgium has gone green, thanks in large measure to donations from private companies. . . The floor space of the Louis XVI-style house is in excess of 16,000 square feet (1,500 square meters) — larger than six average American houses put together — which must have made heating it quite a project, especially as the attic was completely uninsulated.” \r\n (See also, U.S. Embassy in Brussels; and, Wall Street Journal Blog on Efficient Embassies Exceeding Expectations.) \r\n League of Green Embassies enlarged the potential of the program that is spearheading our new relationship with energy in US embassies across Europe, and boosting U.S. exports.

Toyota Prius was the first widely recognized and well-accepted hybrid, but its sales in Croatia are very low and Croatia is very far from having a feasible plan to support the introduction of EVs.

German electric car goes 600 kilometers on 6-minute charge \r\n Is Shai Agassi’s dream of an electric car being left in the dust? German firm DBM Energy unveiled its own electric-powered car with a battery technology it claims is a quantum leap forward. Instead of Better Place’s 160 kilometers on a single charge, DBM’s car can travel more than 600 kilometers on a charge that takes all of six minutes. Agassi’s car needs hours. The prototype is based on an Audi A2 and is a joint effort of DBM, Audi, Lekker Energie and the German government. The car’s first road trip took it from Munich to Berlin last week, a 605 kilometer drive, at normal speeds. Japanese engineers have run a Daihatsu electric car 1,003 kilometers on a single charge, but that was at 40 kilometers an hour and the car was fitted with especially large batteries that are not commercially viable. ‏(Daniel Schmil‏) \r\n More is hidden than revealed regarding Better Place's strategic cooperation with GE. \r\n There is more to the partnership agreement signed by Better Place and General Electric (NYSE: GE) last week than meets the eye. The agreement hints at GE Capital's return to the Israeli vehicle leasing market, the moving up of a gear in the Israel Corp. (TASE:ILCO) project to develop a vehicle in China, and a potentially profitable exit for Better Place's investors. An attempt to understand the entire picture of Better Place's electric vehicle project is a bit like putting together a puzzle with hundreds of pieces. It's all the more difficult when the puzzle is spread over several continents and a few islands. Better Place itself does not help those trying to figure out the puzzle. Despite a sophisticated public relations campaign covering the international media, the company tends not to be forthright when face with questions about specific aspects of the business. One often receives the answer, \"We are a private company that is not obligated to report.\" Better Place's strategic cooperation with GE is a typical example in which more is hidden than revealed.

Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu  28 Sep 10 16:45 \r\n Renault has begun field tests in Israel of the electric car for Better Place. \r\n French carmaker Renault SA (Euronext: RNO) has begun fields tests in Israel of the electric car for Shai Agassi's Better Place LLC. Marketing of the cars is due to begin next year. Two prototypes of the Renault Fluence ZE, tailored for Israel, arrived last month, together with a company technical team. The cars have the rapid battery replacement system located in the rear. Until now, only prototypes with the fixed battery or replaceable battery, which Better Place developed itself, have arrived in Israel. The timing of the test was determined in part to test the cars' handling in Israel's extreme summer heat. The cars are also due to participate in a system-wide test that Better Place will conduct shortly. This test will cover the cars' ignition and battery replacement systems (there are currently two robotic battery replacement systems in the country), the remote management network, and other elements of Better Place's service model.

CT\u0026amp;T, a Korean-based world leader in manufacturing electric vehicles, in a joint venture with 2AM Group of Spartanburg, South Carolina, under the name CT\u0026amp;T Southeast LLC, will invest $21 million and create 370 new jobs to support its production over the next five years.  Company officials project the Spartanburg County facility to be fully operational by the fourth quarter of this year.  \r\n “Upstate South Carolina is an ideal location for our first North American assembly facility,” said CT\u0026amp;T Chief Executive Officer Young Gi Lee.  “We are very happy to be located in an area that provides automotive infrastructure, a skilled workforce and proximity to markets that are prime targets for electric vehicle ownership.” \r\n Full Article:  http://sccommerce.com/resources/press-releases-announcements/ctt-and-2am-group-join-establish-electric-vehicle-production7 \r\n Better Place unveils Tokyo electric car project \r\n Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu, 26 April 2010 \r\n Better Place LLC today officially unveiled in Tokyo a three-month trial of electric cars for the city's taxi fleet. The project includes the recharging and rapid battery replacement stations developed by the company. Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is a partner in the electric taxi project and is financing it. The trial is one of series of electric car trials undertaken by the ministry. Tokyo's largest cab company, Nihon Kotsu Co. Ltd. is also a partner. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (TSE: 7201) is providing the vehicles, and A123 Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: AONE) is providing the batteries. At the dedication ceremony, Better Place CEO Shai Agassi said that if the project moves from demonstration to implementation, 300 battery replacement stations would be needed to handle Tokyo's 60,000-strong taxi fleet. A senior Japanese government official said, \"The project will set an example for other cities in Japan.\" The launch of the system in Tokyo is a prelude to a similar project in Israel in the second half of 2010, which will use Renault SA (Euronext: RNO) electric cars. \r\n Israeli company to launch world's first electric taxi fleet in Tokyo \r\n TheMarker Correspondent and Staff , Ora Coren, 21 April 2010 \r\n Better Place is set to launch its pilot project for the world's first electric taxi fleet on Monday in Tokyo. The pilot will be launched in Tokyo's central Roppongi Hills, where Better Place is building a battery switch site. Participants are expected to include Nihon Kotsu, Tokyo's largest taxi operator; the directors general of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry; and officials from Better Place, which is run by Shai Agassi and Idan Ofer. Better Place announced in August that the Japanese government had chosen it to run the pilot, in partnership with Nihon Kotsu. Better Place has stated that Tokyo has about 60,000 taxis, which is far more than New York City, Hong Kong or Paris. The main challenge will be overcoming the battery's 160-kilometer maximum range. Better Place will install stations for charging and replacing batteries. It says the process is simple - drivers will be able to stay in their cabs while the battery is replaced. \"Better Place is setting up the world's first battery replacement stations for electric cars,\" said Kiyotaka Fujii, President of Better Place Japan and head of business development for Asia Pacific. One of the Japanese Environment Ministry's goals is to have at least half of all new cars running on electricity by 2020, in order to help the country meet its carbon emission goals. While taxis represent a mere 2% of all passenger vehicles on the road in Japan, they are responsible for approximately 20% of all carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles, because of the great number of kilometers they travel, Better Place has stated. \r\n Renault unveils Better Place car \r\n Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu, 15 April 2010 \r\n The Fluence ZE is bigger and much heavier than the conventional model, and is electronically limited to 135 km/h. \r\n Today, Renault revealed details and specifications of the electric-powered Renault Fluence ZE, which will make its world debut in Israel, and will be the car offered by Shai Agassi's electric car venture Better Place in the coming years. Despite lines similar to those of the conventionally-powered Fluence sold in Israel, the new car has several important structural differences. To carry the battery in the rear, it has been stretched to 4.75 meters in length, almost 13 centimeters longer than the ordinary Fluence. The rear part has been widened to an overall width of 1.81 meters to preserve balanced proportions. Despite the length, drivers will have to make do with a baggage compartment of only 300 liters, similar to that of the tiny Renault Clio, because of the huge volume of the battery, which weighs 250 kilograms. The car's overall weight is also not dainty: despite the absence of a benzene engine in the front, the Fluence ZE weighs 1,543 kilograms, almost 300 kilograms more than the benzene version. Renault has not disclosed performance details, but does say that the maximum speed is electronically limited to 135 kilometers an hour. The passenger cell is as roomy as that of the ordinary Fluence, and the car comes generously accessorized, including a built in LCD screen for a smart navigation system, double electronic climate control, and so on. The Fluence ZE is designed to support three charging methods. The first uses an ordinary household socket (10 ampere, 16 ampere, or 200 volt), taking 6-8 hours for a full charge. The second method uses a fast industrial charger, which can charge the battery in just 30 minutes. The third method is Better Place's battery swapping method. It is not yet known whether Better Place will allow the import of electric cars that can be charged via household sockets rather than using its exclusive battery exchange network. Incidentally, the car has charging ports on both sides. Renault points out that it has undertaken to supply 100,000 of these cars to Better Place up to 2016. Better Place has stated several times that it has orders for tens of thousands of cars like these for fleets in Israel, and that it estimates that sales will be in the tens of thousands of units in the first full year of operation. \r\n A survey by the Market Watch Institute for \"Globes\" found that 60% of respondents had heard about Better Place. \r\n Globes' correspondent, 15 February 2010 \r\n Shay Agassi's electric car venture Better Place LLC has won a strong spot in Israelis' consciousness. A survey by the Market Watch Institute for \"Globes\" found that 60% of respondents had heard about the venture. Beginning in 2011, it will be possible to buy electric cars from Better Place. Car fleet operators will also be able to supply customers with electric cars. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Nasdaq: TEVA; TASE: TEVA), Amdocs Ltd. (NYSE: DOX), and Pelephone Communications Ltd. are some of the companies that have signed cooperation agreements with Better Place. 20.3% of the 494 respondents said that they would definitely be willing to drive an electric car instead of a gasoline car. 26.6% of these respondents have a company car. 57% of respondents who have a company car said that were thinking about switching to an electric car. Not a single respondent who has a company car said that they would definitely not drive an electric car. \r\n Dor Alon gas stations will set up charging stations for electric cars. \r\n Globes' correspondent, 7 February 2010 \r\n Shai Agassi's Better Place LLC has signed an agreement with Dor Alon Energy in Israel (1988) Ltd. (TASE:DRAL) to set up battery replacement points for the venture's electric cars at Dor Alon gas stations. The agreement comes two weeks after Better Place raised $350 million from a syndicate led by HSBC Holdings plc (LSE:HSBA; HKSE: 005; NYSE, Paris: HBC) and Israel Corporation (TASE: ILCO). \r\n Better Place will initially launch a pilot program at a number of Dor Alon gas stations within the next few weeks. Better Place will bear the cost of the pilot. The battery replacement points will operate alongside the gas stations' regular business. \r\n Better Place CEO Moshe Kaplinksy said, \"Dor Alon is the first to realize that in order to provide energy solutions for future vehicles, it must provide suitable solutions for consumers now. Dor Alon's gas stations on intercity roads, including Road 6, will provide the owners of electric cards worry-free travel, even on long trips.\" \r\n Dor Alon CEO Israel Yaniv said, \"Dor Alon is the first energy company that will enable owners of electric car owners of the future to obtain electric refueling services at its gas stations. We consider this agreement with Better Place to be a strategic partnership that will create real value and innovation for the company's activity.\" \r\n Dor Alon's share fell 4% by midday today to NIS 94.66, giving it a market cap of NIS 1.39 billion. \r\n Israel Corp. has invested $225 million in Chery-Quantum for a 50% stake in the joint venture. \r\n Dubi Ben-Gedalyahu, 31 January 2010 \r\n One clue to the mystery surrounding the $1.25 billion company value achieved by Better Place LLC in last week's investment, lies in China. On Friday, the official Chinese press disclosed initial technical details about the compact jeep under development by Chery-Quantum LLC, a joint venture between Better Place shareholder Israel Corporation (TASE: ILCO) and Chery Automobile Company Co. Ltd. \r\n Israel Corp. invested $225 million in Chery-Quantum for a 50% stake in the joint venture. Last year, Chery-Quantum changed its plans to build premium cars to focus on an electric jeep. According to the Chinese media, the new Chery-Quantum compact jeep, which bears the code T21, was designed at a studio in Milan, and resembles the general design of Chery's Tiggo 5, but is smaller. The T21 will have a replaceable battery, which will probably be made by A123 Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: AONE) of the US, in which Israel Corp. is a shareholder. The battery will be located on the T21's double floor. \r\n The Chinese press believes that the T21 is primarily designed to meet European and US standards, and that it will be one of Better Place's strategic models for the second stage of its penetration into new markets in mid-to-late 2012. Industry sources believe that Israel Corp. plans to supply Better Place with electric cars that suit the latter's batter replacement model, which it has demonstrated to potential investors, and which helped boost the company value for the latest investment. \r\n In a separate development, sources inform ''Globes'' that Better Place is presenting the final model of its battery replacement station, which includes a storage and management network. The model has been built and is operating at the company's closed hangar in Petah Tikva.

Will they check other restricted parties lists -- those I can't sell to? \r\n A: Usually yes, but it is something that should be discussed prior to exporting. \r\n   \r\n Q: Does this presentation apply if our customers are individuals? They're talking about buyers but are these buyers companies or B2B relationships? Can they mention how this would relate if say, we sell directly online to consumers and want to ship to international destinations? \r\n A: Whether your buyer is an end user (consumer) or business, the same licensing, regulations, foreign country import requirements, etc. generally apply. \r\n   \r\n Q: how do I find the specialist forwarder? Many forwarders will indicate they do the service which might not be their specialty. \r\n A: Find out who your competitors are using, ask the FF what their specialization is before indicating what your industry/product is; inquire with NCBFAA. \r\n   \r\n Q: where can I find more info on Free Trade Agreements and benefits to my company? \r\n A: A wealth of info is available onthe export.gov Free Trade Agreements pages. \r\n   \r\n Q: What percent of a product must be made in the U.S. in order for it to be considered of U.S. origin? \r\n A: It varies. Generally 51% for commercial invoice purposes, To meet various FTA criteria and qualify for those benefits, US content may differ. I would encourage you to contact 1-800-872-8723 (800-USA-TRADE) for more specific guidance. \r\n   \r\n Q: On the AES: If my individual Schedule B number is valued less than $2500 per item, but the total quantity added together per Schedule B item is more than $2500, is this still required? For example my item is valued at $1000, but I'm shipping qty. 10 of them. \r\n A: yes, if the total shipment value is 2500 or more, AES is required. \r\n   \r\n Q: Does information apply if I want to ship individual (small/medium size packages) to foreign countries? \r\n A: Yes, generally. There are times when a direct consumer purchase for individual use will not be subject to particular country import requirements (example cosmetics), but all shipment / licensing issues remain the same. \r\n   \r\n Q: What was the website for that certification course? \r\n A: www.ncbfaa.org \r\n   \r\n Q: After appointing a forwarder and provided them the documentation, the forwarder later request an approval to another forwarder may vary the cost.  How should I deal with this situation? Have the forwarder has the right to make changes  \r\n A: I am not sure I understand this question and would need additional information to answer.  There should only be one forwarder used on each side.  If at some point the forwarder determined he was unable to handle the shipment and he suggested the shipment be turned over to another forwarder; each forwarders fees will probably be different.  \r\n   \r\n Q: Again regarding EXW (ex-works) - we usually ship ex-works and check denied parties lists via MK Denial. Did I hear you say I also need to check to see if the vessel is on a list? Ours are \"routed transactions where the FPPI selects the forwarder and they or the FF select the vessel  \r\n A: There was a question asked about checking the vessel against denied parties, but I have not heard of this.  Only parties to the transactions; companies and individuals, are screened.   When taking out marine cargo insurance there is an additional premium due on any vessel over a certain age so possibly this is what the questions was referring to. \r\n   \r\n Q: After appointing a forwarder and provided them the documentation, the forwarder later request an approval to another forwarder may vary the cost.  How should I deal with this situation? Have the forwarder has the right to make changes – \r\n A. same question as above \r\n   \r\n Q: Does this liability apply even if the carriage arrangement is FOB your warehouse and Buyer has made all arrangements?  \r\n A: If you are not named on the ocean bill of lading you would not have liability for the general average or carriage, but will you get paid for your shipment if the cargo is not picked up? \r\n   \r\n Q: If liability is transferred to the importer at the time of shipping and the freight forwarder works for the importer, will the exporter still be liable for the documents?  \r\n A: If this is a routed shipment and you are not named on the ocean bill of lading you would not have liability for the general average or carrier.  In a routed transaction the buyer appoints the freight forwarder and the freight forwarder prepares the required documentation upon the buyer’s instructions; however you are still the USPPI and are responsible for providing information to the forwarder so that the correct Electronic Export Information can be filed.  Also you are always responsible for adhering to the export Administration Regulations.  Here is an interesting question – what if your buyer diverts the cargo to an embargoed country? \r\n   \r\n Q: Is there general average on air freight? Any other insurance issues specific to air?   \r\n A: There is not a “general average” type situation on air freight cargo, however the airlines do have a limit of liability.  Generally air freight premiums are slightly less than ocean freight premiums. \r\n   \r\n Q: Previously we have shipped engineering samples (product that is not yet available to the public) to end users in EMEA.  These units are provided for testing only and not for resale. However, the destination customs offices are applying additional customs duties which require our end user to have to pay the additional duty/tax before they can retrieve the package.  As the shipper, what can we do to ensure the end user will not have to pay these charges?  Note: commercial invoice specifies the device has no commercial value.  \r\n A: This will depend on the country of import’s regulations which will vary from country to country.  Just because one country does not assess duty on samples, it doesn’t mean all do.   If the samples are being returned to the US, there may be other options. \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-13","title":"How to Ship Your Products","update_date":"2013-05-15","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["Freight Forwarder","Shipping"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"463","content":" Use data to pinpoint markets in specific countries.

Laszlo without further ado I’d like to turn over the phone and looking forward to your presentation. \r\n Laszlo Horvath: Roza, thank you so much for the introduction. Hello, everybody. It is my absolute delight to meet with an audience so diverse and exciting like today’s audience. We have manufacturers, we have service companies from all corners of the United States and the world and also agencies, governments that help them to export at different levels. \r\n As Roza mentioned, our motto is can you afford not to be found? Well, that’s a rhetorical question because obviously when you have customers who are looking for your products and services, you simply have to engage with those customers; otherwise, two things can happen. \r\n One, they connect with your competitors; two, you don’t book that revenue that you never knew you lost so this is a critical subject, finding those customers who are in the moment of their need, the highly motivated customers and use the search engines as your virtual sales force. \r\n I’d like to introduce myself briefly. My name is Laszlo Horvath, President of Active Media. I am one of those old, online characters who started about 15 now it’s about 16 years ago when businesses like some of yours had to be convinced to build a Website because they didn’t need it. \r\n They already had fax machines and telephones and physical addresses. Now after everyone built a Website comes the next question, okay, no one sees our Website. They thought that if they build a Website, the sales will come, traffic will come and after a few more years, it turns out that traffic became a key component to a success of a Website so that’s what we do. \r\n Here is a sample of some of our clients. We take pride in delivering the highest possible dominant positions on the search engines results pages on our clients. You can see we have large and small banking and manufacturing, entertainment and consulting clients from all corners of the world so what is the subject of this quick discussion with the audience? \r\n First of all, this is a huge topic, how to use the search engines which are the new operating system of the Internet because this is how people find information. \r\n I’d like to submit to you as a student of the Internet universe that there will be some points that I am going to emphasize and I am going to rush through a couple of other slides to give you a flavor of where we believe in our 15 years practice the most important touch points are to capture an international audience. \r\n This is sort of one of those tricky questions, how many computers are there and how many Webpages are out there? It’s a huge jungle out there. The estimates are ranging between 1 and 3 billions and the number of Webpages is simply when I finish this sentence, will be probably another 100,000 more. \r\n The way to look at this is just to see that clouds out there. There’s a lot of discussion about cloud computing. You can look at this discussion as using the world’s most powerful computer systems, the world’s most powerful clouds to your marketing needs. \r\n The key element, self-selected, motivated buyers find on their own terms their product and services. That creates an environment that leads to the most cost-effective marketing program known to any media which is digital marketing in general and search engine marketing in particular. \r\n You don’t need to interrupt your potential customers with any kinds of sales message. They are going to contact you on their own terms and this is an illustration of a Website that is on the bottom of search engine results. \r\n It looks like a Website but it’s not going to take you where you want to go with your business. It’s not going to bring in sales. Here is the online marketing pyramid. You will notice that there is no traditional media in that mix, even the lowest return potential in your digital marketing program delivers better results than any type of traditional media. \r\n The foundation of your online marketing pyramid is search engine optimization. When you show up on top of a search engine’s results page, then Google, Bing, Baidu, Yahoo says that your company is the leader in that field. \r\n Second one is social media presence when your customers are telling the world that your product is great and they had a tremendous experience with you and if your positive comments are a much higher number than the negative or neutral comments, you are a winner in the social media space. \r\n (Max want his) pay-per-click ads, when people are looking at content that is related to your products and services, having these pay-per-click ads offering a call for action with a potential discount drive international customers to your Website. \r\n Then comes behavioral targeting when people who are likely buyers are connected to a marketing program that delivers a strong sales message and last but not least, e-mail lists. This is our online marketing pyramid. Any of these elements perform better than any other traditional marketing program. \r\n So why search? Simply because it is the most important activity online. Search is the Number 2 application right after using e-mail online although social media is taking over the e-mail on the top of that list so the second and third activity - search and research - is simply what people do online. \r\n About 20%-25% of the searches are local-related and regardless of where your Website and where your business is located, the majority of visitors to your Website come from a country that’s other than yours. \r\n And if you felt that all the information that you gather everyday is overwhelming, well there’s no reason to grieve about that because even today roughly 30% to 50% of the results are relevant to the searchers which means that you didn’t miss the boat. \r\n The message simply is don’t just say what you want people to know about or to read about but make sure that when you say it, you include traffic, include findability in the message so letting people find what you have to say. \r\n We call this the inward-looking approach versus the - we call this the outward-looking approach - versus the inward-looking approach when you are just focused on your mission and your product advantages versus how people search for you. \r\n Why are we discussing this? Because your customer has changed. The search engines create an environment where the browsing as an activity online has disappeared. Your browser is taken over by the fast search box as high-speed Internet access became ubiquitous so having Websites that are invisible for the search engines means that you are denying access to your content. \r\n One example of this is Chrome, Google’s browser which literally combines the browser bar with the search box, makes it much faster to find information so one buzzword that I’d like you to take with you after this presentation from me, the buzzword is SERP, Search Engines Results Pages. \r\n This is the single-most important territory, the single-most important real estate in today’s digital marketing world the search engines results pages. They are your first touch point. \r\n The search engines results pages are your most effective marketing channel because that’s where your customers are and that’s equally true for any of those diverse areas that this audience is working at from quality loudspeakers to power washers or local governments. \r\n In any environment and any business that you represent, the key question is how to stand out globally in this very busy universe? These are three ways to stand out and dominate the search engines results pages: SEO, Search Engine Optimization; SEM, Search Engine Marketing; and Social Media Optimization, SOM. \r\n These are the three channels that help you capture the international audience. You are not alone in this quest. There are thousands and thousands of companies that are dedicated to take advantage of the fact that online marketing expenditure is still lower than traditional media expenditure simply because of the inertia in the marketing industry. \r\n And I’m not going to go into these details just a quick example that television and online roughly have the same significance in people’s live about 12 hours a day are spent on TV or online and the expenditure levels are still much lower online than in broadcast television. This is the growth in expenditure on the Internet per year between 2002 and 2010. \r\n As you can see, the growth is much higher in the Internet industry and 87% of marketers today tell researchers that they want to increase their online presence in 2011 because they understood that it’s a huge force accelerator, increases the impact of other marketing programs as well if you are found in this economy. \r\n And one note for exporters, there is no easier way to find international customers than doing the analysis of how those international buyers search for your products and services, how many of them are out there and what the competition does about this. This is called the keyword analysis which we affectionately in my business call mind-reading. \r\n Reading the minds of your customers helps you tailor a message that captures their imagination. Now that was the introduction and here comes a little bit of a detailed presentation agenda about how to use your virtual global sales force. \r\n We’ll talk very briefly about what is a search engine which sounds redundant but in my experience it’s always an interesting subject because most folks use it without knowing exactly what that is. \r\n And then we’ll cover the three channels, SEO, pay-per-click and the social media optimization and last but not least we are going to talk a few words about global usage trends and we’ll show a brief case study if we have time for that. \r\n So why are search engines so successful? Because this is our answer to a sensory overload, the thousands and thousands of marketing messages that we get. We live in the world of a digital tsunami. According to the SCS Institute, we carry the load that is four times larger in noise each day. It’s a scary number. Each day digital data, all the transactions worldwide quadruple. \r\n So as an illustration this is how your customers feel. That’s the key to success of the search engines because if you add some more load of information, that’s not going to help your business to sell the products but when this person is actually looking for a solution, maybe a trolley to carry all that data garbage, then you have a chance to interact and win his or her business. \r\n In a way you can look at search engine optimization as a way to get rid of all that redundant noise and in a crystal clear format engage your customers and this is the evolution of our industry, the acceleration is really scary. \r\n If you look at these killer applications, one was AOL. That’s where I started in 1995. It took 15 years to reach close to 300 million users and the key to success was to create a high-speed environment in the low-connectivity connection space so it was a virtual high-speed environment. \r\n Then Google came and took them 10 years to reach 350 million users. Essentially they created the first social media program as well because that’s one of the success factors of search engine visibility that the users own the answers since they typed-in a specific question. \r\n And that’s why Googles and Bings and Yahoos and Baidus and all the other search engines endorsements means an undisputed third-party valuation. It must be true because it’s on top of the search engines and look at Facebook. \r\n In five years they reached 500 million users. Today now they have about 600 million and it’s really effortless. You don’t have to worry about spending time writing an e-mail. You’re always on and you’re always connected so there was an acceleration in our industry. \r\n And, you know, the saying that you know our century we are very lucky because in this hundred years that we live in, more is going to happen with mankind and technology than in the past 100,000 years and it sounds like an exaggeration. \r\n But if you look at the accelerating timeline, they might be right so the consequences, traditional marketing is outdated because it happens on the terms of the marketers and they want to interrupt you with a direct message versus the broadcast, the reverse broadcast model where they customers initiate the contact. \r\n And we live in the age of personalization. We might call it post-advertising because the attention is so fragmented that people have no time to do a huge amount of traditional media consumption and they do video gaming, they do online activities on their own terms and that’s key to success if you ride that wave together with your customers. \r\n Some real-time data from last year, social media expenditure is about close to $2 billion in 2010. Online sales are about $40 billion-plus industry and online ad expenditure is about $26 billion so this is not a baby industry anymore and we are just at the very beginning of another growth curve right here in the social media online sales and online ad spending arena. \r\n So you are already global because the majority of your visitors are online. Message Number 3, if you don’t have an international program on your Website, it means that you send away the majority of the visitors coming to your Website. \r\n So in order to maximize your search dominance, you do need to look at the international opportunities. Roughly about 800 million-plus people are online. This is the number of searches per years, about 61 billion searches per month and that’s growing. \r\n By the way, folks who are addicted to social media platforms, they use more searches than those who are not on social media so the world is really at your fingertips. \r\n And doing a global program on the search engines essentially using the Internet what it was invented for, the Internet is nothing else but a connectivity channel to connect anybody, anywhere and these are the languages just on Google that you can capture. \r\n Now think about all these markets where you can be virtually local in Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, you name it. You can be as local as the store next door to those international customers. \r\n Here is the rush to get online. These are the latest numbers that I can actually trust roughly. Asia is the largest chunk of online users. There is Europe and here is the Americas, North America and Latin America. \r\n And here is essentially the same data by percentages, roughly about 40% of the Internet users are in Asia, about 25-26 are in North and South America - the Americas - and about a quarter of the users are in Europe, a little more and the rest is a smaller percentage. \r\n And this is another interesting number, the penetration of Internet access. North America is the highest. The numbers are a little bit skewed because often times you see different usage patterns in Europe than in North America for example because people use the Internet at work or at academic institutions. \r\n Here the number is essentially much higher because these are just the home users versus the Internet café users and also the mobile users are not included so these numbers are much higher. That’s particularly true in Africa which has a very low home usage percentage, about 5% but with the mobile platforms it’s a much higher number. \r\n So you essentially can capture the majority of users on any continent and here is just the reach of one network - paid advertising content network - about close to 600 million people just on Google’s network and 92% of Latin America, 88% of the users in Asia/Pacific and 91% of Europe can be reached so here comes some details about these three channels. \r\n As I am rushing into the finish of the presentation, what is a search engine? Essentially it’s a database where all the information is found by a crawler, put into an index which is a hierarchy of results and the algorithm determines who is Number 1 and who is 2,000,736. \r\n This is the single-most important slide of the presentation. The organic or natural results are the crown jewels. This is where you get the third-party validation. This is where your undisputed leadership lies. \r\n And these are the pay-per-click programs where you can supplement your digital leadership by offering a special deal where you drive customers who are bargain hunters and there could be bargain hunters in the B-to-B field as well. \r\n They don’t want free shipping. What they want is a free case study or some perceived value-added service. Search engine optimization, we are just going to run through these benefits and please do let me know if you have questions about this. \r\n It’s essentially presenting your case to the search engine spiders so you get a dominant placement at the end of the process. Essentially he has three relevant points. One is the mind reading, when you really understand your customer, how they search for your products and services, how many of them are out there and what the competition does about this. \r\n After you know this, you essentially have raw data for a digital marketing plan. You know what the market wants from you. You know the size of the market and you know the competitive landscape. \r\n After that you are ready to modify or build your Website that’s Phase 2 the page level deliverable when your Website becomes an extension of the search, of the search engine’s results pages. \r\n And the third and simply the most important component is the link popularity building and that subject alone of how to put your Website in the larger context of the Internet deserves a multi-day discussion and I’m more than happy to talk about those technical details one-on-one or in the Q\u0026amp;A session. \r\n That’s the area where you essentially beat your competitors, all things equal so if the pricing is the same and the quality of your product is the same, the link popularity building is going to create the gift that keeps on giving. \r\n Here is typical results experience and now comes the description in the presentation of the pay-per-click advertisements where you buy clicks, you pay every time someone clicks on these ads. You don’t pay when they just review it but they don’t click and here are the advantages of doing pay-per-click advertising though most of the pay-per-click users use Google. \r\n The majority of them also uses Yahoo so 60% use Yahoo, 95% use Google and there was also a significant audience for other search engines. It depends on which market you are targeting. Some search engines are dominant. The exceptions - the three notable exceptions - where Google is not dominant is China where Baidu is the big player. \r\n Russia where Google doesn’t really have a huge market share and the Czech Republic. The rest of the world is dominated by Google and it’s about 70% in the United States and 15% is Bing and 15% is Yahoo. This is another laundry list of comparisons of how search engine optimization compares to a pay-per-click program, advantages and disadvantages. \r\n I like these laundry lists because you can use them as checkmarks and search engine optimization comes hand-in-hand with social media optimization when the positive comments come up on top of the results pages and we’ll talk more about this during (Larry)’s presentation and here is a quick key study of how to use search engine optimization creatively. \r\n One of our clients is a hotel chain, Magical Cusco Tours and they wanted to stand out - they understood so their - they understood the advantage of standing out in the social media space so their instructions for us was Laszlo, make us stand out in relevant results pages. \r\n So we created a program. We essentially created a search engine optimization program for them when they received 300-plus top level placements and also an ongoing pay-per-click program for special deals in traveling to Cusco. They also created a solution where they realized that people are searching for two completely different products that they did not offer. \r\n One was spiritual tours to go to the Inca tour and meditate. The other one was culinary tours that became the most profitable ventures for them. The strength of networks, when you work with partner companies, the effect of search engine optimization increases. \r\n This is called the ecosystem, the digital ecosystem so when you have partners and you create a link program between those partners, the effects of search engine optimization multiple and this is a disruptive technology when a smaller company can become a significant international player and last message here is control your digital footprint. \r\n Control your search engine organic results, create a pay-per-click program and create a dominant search engine and social media optimization program because there are three options there. \r\n Either you control your digital footprint, what people think about you and what people say about you in addition to how your message shows up on the search engines results pages, that’s the best case scenario. \r\n Second scenario is kiosks. It goes just chaotically whichever information the spiders find relevant will come up on top and the third one is when your digital space is controlled by a competitor, that’s the least favorable option. \r\n And thank you so much for your time. I apologize for rushing through this presentation but I am delighted to answer during the Q\u0026amp;A or after that and I hand it over to the social media expert, (Larry). \r\n Rosa Pace: Okay, (Larry), before you speak, thank you, Laszlo for a wonderful presentation, informative and hopefully folks will find some useful ideas and thank you for the opportunity for companies to follow-up with you with their questions and please also understand that we like to remind you that during this presentation, you are able to type your questions by clicking on Q\u0026amp;A tab at the top of the presentation and let me briefly introduce (Larry). \r\n (Larry Smith) as I say is our next presenter. We are very excited to have (Larry) to talk about shifting consumer B-to-B approach towards e-commerce (stat upon) the evolution of international business, marketing and sales, talk a bit about value of social media strategy to your international business and other topics. (Larry), the floor is yours. \r\n (Larry Smith): Thank you, Roza, I appreciate it. Good afternoon, everyone, and we’re very honored to be part of this Webinar. Welcome to Zeons Global’s international business social media overview. A breakthrough in export marketing and sales that helped you engage new international customers in markets with products and services. \r\n During this brief presentation, I’ll explain how social media can help your company create, expand and engage new market overseas, increasing profitability and improve brand awareness. \r\n First let me go over the agenda which is obviously an introduction to the corporate overview; social media defined; the evolution of business, marketing and sales; past present and future trends and challenges; capitalizing on exports with social media; summary of benefits; and then lastly how you can contact us. \r\n I’d appreciate it if we could keep all questions and answers to the end but there is a chat window and my colleague (Adam King) will be happy to answer any questions you have in the chat window. \r\n Many U.S. companies struggle when it comes to expanding internationally. It’s a challenge to enter foreign markets, launch new products or simply cater to foreign requests. Firms that don’t do well overseas typically don’t have a clearly articulated or developed strategy, a database of customers or prospects, multi-lingual staff and literally no brand awareness in the target market. \r\n Whatever your situation, it’s difficult to get enough traction with decision-makers overseas. Many firms try to develop an export department internally but it just failed to produce the desired results. \r\n With little to no export department when a firm gets busy, pipeline activity slows, leads get dropped or allowed to get cold and the firm experiences the all-too-recognizable revenue roller coaster which deters them from focusing on developing and nurturing the lucrative markets overseas. \r\n That’s where we come in, Zeons Global. Zeon’s Global is a multinational company which assists and facilitates the export of U.S.-manufactured goods into emerging international markets in Latin America, Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East. \r\n Zeons Global is an integrated company characterized by substantial inter-group and inter-sector cooperation in research manufacturing and marketing of products incorporating similar component materials manufactured at common internal sources. \r\n Zeons Global is a U.S. conglomerate with businesses categorized into agriculture, asset acquisitions, consumer goods, export and export management and training, media consulting, power fuel and Zeons Global is renown both globally and locally. \r\n Zeons Global has a physical footprint in 27 countries servicing more than 455,000 customers serviced by eight business groups. Zeons Global has been evolving to become the United States’ largest, most diversified public company. \r\n Our decades of success and strong reputation provide from our proven ability to provide high-level professional solutions and consumer products coupled with outstanding consumer service that deliver results. Within this century, Zeons Global has built this foundation on the export of Made in USA goods and services. \r\n Social media: what is it? Who is it for? Why care? Is it about everything people have said about social media? Social media is just basic communication like what you do every day. Executives and probably most social media experts often focus too much on a challenge. \r\n Facebook, Twitters, forums, blogs, Podcasts, pictures and videos are just channels, a bridge to communicate with targeted audiences. The thing about these channels is languages. They can be mastered easily but content and value of the conversation is all that matters. \r\n (Seth Gody) said on his blog, “It’s a process, not an event.” In business, companies should invest in social media for quick results. It’s a process to build relationships with potential customers and maintain good relationships with existing customers. \r\n Most brands and many agencies focus way too much on social media topics such as launching a Facebook page, Twitter, creating apps and trying to create viral videos. Some might get lucky and create (both) but it’s very risky to be focused on tactics. Tactics should come last, after building a solid foundation of brand image, personality and engagement online. \r\n Why invest in social media if it’s just a process while there are other medias like TV ads, magazine ads and online ads that shows quicker impact? There are tons of reasons for it but the biggest reason would be can you afford not to? \r\n In business, social media shouldn’t play the role in direct selling. It should instead influence viral conversations, build brand awareness, improve customer service and engage your target as a friend. Think about it. \r\n When making purchase decisions, would you trust a friend or an advertisement? With regards to the images in this particular slide in the lower left-hand corner, you see four distinct differences. (Barry Gillis) who we all know as a great survival expert says if you brain works, you can survive almost anything. \r\n We all sure know MacGyver. All he needed was a pen and a paper clip to make anything work. Albert Einstein said the only source of knowledge is experience and what about those guys on the Apollo mission who started out with the right stuff and thought it was a journey and it became an adventure? \r\n When you take all these plus by sharing it instantly around the world multiplying it with people, you get the social technology based upon what we have today in the Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia and others. \r\n Let’s talk about the big picture. Why do you want to go international? Over 23 trade agreements have been created to decrease America’s trade deficit. These trade agreements, NAFTA, CAFTA and WTO to name a few have lowered many trade restrictions for U.S. products giving U.S. exporters an unprecedented level of access to many international markets. \r\n These reductions have helped all U.S. businesses. In the top there you see the world. All we see is potential. Ninety-five percent of the world’s population and two-thirds of total world’s purchasing power are located outside the United States. Imagine the potential as the worlds becomes more integrated and develops similar like product. \r\n Next one. Sorry about this. Okay. Sorry about that. The economic growth. Consumer preferences shaped primarily by incomes, changing lifestyles and evolving cultural preferences largely determine the items available in stores in different markets. \r\n As you see there to the right, it’s an engagement life-cycle of economic shifts, social technologies and globalization which affects it all and the association there is that if you’re a small business and dealt with quickly enough, you run the risk of a threat of not being able to react as you move forward. \r\n To generate straight interest with potential export markets, you need to first determine what messages and products will resonate and then articulate those messages and products and their value. \r\n By creating relationships with Tweets, Facebook updates, LinkedIn connections and custom e-mails, all of these collectively build an initial relationship with the target market and audience creating positive brand experiences which becomes potential sources of revenue. \r\n Most prospects are not ready to buy right away and sophisticated overseas buyers will only engage your products when they see the benefits of doing so and when they are good and ready. Using social media will allow you to nurture and enhance the relationship with specific messages delivered for its different types of customers that is right for them. \r\n If you look at the bar graph of the world Internet penetration, you will immediately notice that the emerging regional markets depict greater opportunities in developing, nurturing and engaging international customers with social media tools as a cost-effective and important source of product and service development. \r\n Now look at the time spent on Facebook versus Google. Mind you this is just representative of Americans online. You can ascertain it from the phenomenal growth of social media as a palatable medium to engage future customers, clients and partners that is a viable medium to access new customers and markets if done correctly. \r\n And in the world Internet penetration rate, you will see as Laszlo already mentioned how basically Asia and Africa are so far behind North America, Oceana and Europe as a very good opportunity to start going internationally. \r\n Past, present and future trends, the value of social media strategy for your international business. How did we do business in the past? Well, we all did mailings or phone calls and things. How do we it today? E-mail lists. Some of us are still doing phone calls and even mailings. \r\n What is the future? Well, the future is that social media. If we utilize the social media tools to harvest international customers, you really need to have a mindset in place that is not a magical solution that will produce immediate results. \r\n It is a prolonged effort to solidify your brand presence. Businesses open to its customers and partners and stakeholders, social media technology is about the ability to connect with them for a collaborative action in a scalable and cost-effective manner. \r\n By collaborating with the consumer, you create your business outfit with them, an outfit they buy into. This often means cheaper and more effective service, products and communications as well as deeper consumer loyalty. \r\n Integrated international business development social media campaigns are designed to break through directly to the consumer and create conversations that are valuable to them. The multi-phased approach to social media not only creates qualified prospects and nurtured relationships but it builds brand preference. \r\n By including value and thought leadership in all communication, not only do potential prospects know who you are but they can articulate what you can do for them. \r\n As your communications are sustained over time, prospective clients won’t forget you. Indeed, they will remember you at the elusive time of need and you will have top-of-mind awareness that firms covet. Now top-of-mind awareness is great but it’s great when customers want to work with you. \r\n Monetizing social media. As international business development in social media focuses on communicating and developing your value and the prospect of generation and nurturing process, prospects will not only remember you but they’ll look forward to doing business with you. \r\n Now with regards to social media monetarizing, so how do you monetize this media for your business? Well, you set clear business goals. Social media itself is not a strategy. It is a set of tools that help support a business strategy. Before investing resources into social media, decide what you plan to achieve. \r\n Ask yourself why your site exists. Do you sell online? Do you encourage store visits? Your social media should do the same and it should be measurable. It’s not enough to focus on number of site visits, fans or followers. Create paths of continuous participation. Keep visitors engaged. \r\n Don’t stop the point of direction. For example, if a customer writes a review for a product on your site, send him a follow-up e-mail encouraging them to answer other consumers’ questions about that product. \r\n Upload your own product photos or write a product story. These interactions will also encourage other consumers to participate. Engage everyone, not just contributors. Your visitors, customers, experts and (imports) are the only ones who contribute and have benefit from your community. \r\n Engage employees by inviting them to answer visitor or customer questions. Have a spokesperson for a celebrity endorser contribute a story about how they interact with your product. Give suppliers and manufacturers access to your community so they can share their product expertise. \r\n Make your efforts contextually relevant. Everything a consumer sees should contribute to his or her goals for the interaction. In other words, if people generally come to your site to buy something, well online interactions should help them toward that goal. \r\n The community should exist to support consumers. As a brand, you can’t dictate what a consumer buys but you can give them superior access to information that will help them evaluate the products. The brand no longer dictates what a customer buys. It’s the experience that we have in your valuation process. \r\n Consumers get recommendations from friends, analyze peer reviews, and evaluate alternatives. Help them do this in your community. Drive revenue not just with metrics. A recent survey of CMOs showed that 81% of CMOs expect to link their annual revenues directly to their social media investment in 2010. \r\n Metric sales conversions, revenue and average order value, figures that track directly to the bottom line are replacing metrics such as site traffic or page views. You can also use your online community to improve customer support while decreasing customers’ costs. \r\n Summary of benefits. Getting a social media program is an exciting opportunity and a chance to dramatically change the way you connect with consumers. It is a tool that allows you to tap into conversations for more about how your brand is perceived, promote your product/service in new ways and ultimately grow your business. \r\n Often the things you learn a social media can inform your more traditional marketing efforts as you engage directly with your audience and learn more about what makes them tick. Social media while trendy is a fully mainstream communications tool. \r\n Properly prepare your social media strategy including goals and measurement to ensure you get the most out of your program. Taking a simple four-step approach to prepare for the launch of a successful social media program can ensure that you set-up to interact in social media venues before you get started. \r\n This approach includes identifying your goals, finding your audience, setting your key performance indicators, scheduling a resource management. Program building gives you a chance to focus your efforts and to determine what kind of manpower you will be needing to support efforts. \r\n You will also set-up your criteria for success in advance by creating a set of metrics. This will take some of the uncertainty out of your social media program enabling you to know when you are doing things right and when adjustments need to be made. \r\n Our 10-step approach to a successful social media program is: listen to and observe what the target audience is doing in social media; create a solid object that is relevant to the brand of genuine interest; segment the target into tribes, give them something they can join; allow them to engage via their preferred platform of choice, create multiple interfaces to your community; make the experience better when shared; optimize your content for sharing, particularly via newsfeeds and Twitter; use pay for media to get the ball rolling; take advantage of extreme targeting by social networks; make sure you have the resources to manage your community management and refresh the content; and lastly track the results and optimize where necessary. \r\n Enable, inspire, influence and engage. If you are a manufacturer of building materials, industry machinery, automotive aftermarket accessories and vehicles, vitamins or supplements, food products, apparel, aerospace, consumer goods or agricultural products seeing to expand internationally and don’t have the relationships or know-how in place and are looking to implement a proven system instead of developing something internally, you don’t have to go it alone. \r\n Zeons Global international business development will be right here for you. The benefits are extensive. All we see is growth potential. Exports growing three times faster sales here in the U.S. of the world’s population and two-thirds of the total world purchasing power are located outside the U.S. \r\n Deepen relationships; by engaging the prospect you are deepening your relationship with them and building an affinity for your brand. Having your prospects participate in a process will create a value-added relationship that will translate into future sales dollars. \r\n Integration into the marketing mix; once you’ve properly defined your goals in levering social media to interact with your prospects, integrating these activities into your overall marketing fix is a sure-fire way to get measurable results for your marketing budget. \r\n That’s what’s great about this meeting is you can create specific landing pages that draw traffic from these social media tools with direct marketing efforts to get a clearer picture of ROI. \r\n Ready, aim, fire. Once you’ve mastered the art of communicating with your consumers, the social media launch in new products becomes a science. Build the brand. \r\n As you build your relationship with new customers with incentives, recognition and programs, just any market share against the competition allows you to harvest opportunities in the marketplace for the longer term. \r\n The relationships, prospects and revenues that we have developed for our clients speaks for themselves. We have developed thousands of new relationships, integrated millions of new dollars in revenue and have been able to penetrate anywhere between 10 to 50% of our clients’ target markets in over 27 different countries. \r\n This is just representative of the types of companies we deal with. Every client is of course different. We look forward to speaking with you and learning about your goals, markets and needs. \r\n Zeons Global benefits the U.S. companies that it represents through their established sales network abroad. Dealing with Zeons Global allows access to their existing network and resources to appoint distributors and dealers in select markets. \r\n Zeons Global has the ability to handle all of the details of an export transaction. This includes the know-how to handle inquiries, prepare quotations, enter orders, handle shipping details, assist with country-specific obstacles and handle the international banking and payment details. \r\n Zeons Global’s greatest asset is its strength of connection to the international firms they work with. We have the experience to select agents and distributors. Zeons Global can also manage the foreign distribution network through its visits to the markets they distribute into. \r\n Traveling abroad for the first-hand experience also allows us to assess market conditions and sales opportunities. If you choose to work with Zeons Global, the advantages you will notice are quicker export sales. \r\n Zeons Global has an established network of foreign agents and distributors. If your product is ready for a particular market, you will have the built-in distribution system. Normally we generate three to five deployments with decision-makers who are interested in building a relationship. \r\n Fewer expenses; companies’ out-of-pocket expenses will be less as most of the labor expenses will only be realized upon successful appointment of a distributor and when the orders are placed. \r\n Time; Zeons Global’s dedication to its international sales, relationships and customer service is a very important part of export sales. Zeons Global has the time and incentive to develop export business. Even with the appropriate financed resources, you may lack the time to focus on this because of other priorities. \r\n Often this time is more appropriately spent on building domestic market and export details are overlooked. Learning from those with experience, a great way to learn about export transactions is by working with Zeons Global. \r\n Use the opportunity to work together to learn how things are handled and thank you very much for the time allotted for this presentation and we hope you do more of this in the future. \r\n Roza Pace: Thank you (Larry) for this presentation. A lot of useful information of how companies can use social media in their marketing strategy. Again we are approaching top of the hour. We have a few minutes for question and answer. We appreciate everyone staying online and I would like to turn over to operator to invite participants with any questions that they may have. \r\n Coordinator: Just a reminder, to ask a question please press star then 1. Please be sure to unmute your phone and clearly record your name when prompted. Again that’s star then 1 and we will allow a few moments for any questions to come in. \r\n Roza Pace: Now maybe since we are waiting for a question, perhaps my question is here at the Department of Commerce we receive a lot of inquiries on exporting from small and medium-sized companies that may be new to exporting or new to market and what kind of a budget or manpower a small company should consider to really engage in both sort of a Website part of the business, making it perfect and as well as the social media? \r\n Either (Larry), or Laszlo, I’d love to hear your comments or, you know, answer to that. \r\n Coordinator: Excuse me, (Elizabeth Donnelly), your line is open. \r\n (Elizabeth Donnelly): Yes, I was just interested to hear some specifics on how customers can be reached outside the U.S. through social media or through SEO. I have a whole set of social media that I’ve been using for a long time but I lack of a lot of international customers. How can I reach to those and in an effective manner? \r\n And in addition to that how do I search engine optimize for those international customers? \r\n Laszlo Horvath: Is it okay if I start with the search engine optimization part and... \r\n (Elizabeth Donnelly): Sure. \r\n Laszlo Horvath: (Larry) can pitch in about social media. Well, the key is to understand how different international customers are looking for your products and services, Elizabeth, and it’s relatively easy to find out and tying back to Roza’s question, it’s not that cost-prohibitive because a simple analysis of the keyword space where your search engine optimization shop just like our logs-in to the log files of the search engines in the given region that you are looking at. \r\n And we’ve done this in about 40 different languages on all continents and determined the number of search queries in your field that will be an indicator of your future success in your digital marketing effort in that particular language or languages or geographical areas. \r\n And the competitive data, how many Webpages compete for that particular keyword phrase or keyword group will indicate how competitive this space is going to be for you. \r\n After you determine that, then you create a digital marketing program to capture that type of an audience by creating quality content in a search engine optimized fashion and then you apply additional marketing tools based on the online marketing pyramid that was part of my presentation earlier. \r\n So understanding your digital market space in that particular area that you are targeting is key so before you build a Website that is localized to that market, you need to know what those customers want from your company. Does that answer your question? \r\n (Elizabeth Donnelly): Yes, it helps. Now when you talk about - I’m sorry, I got distracted with that call - but take to (unintelligible) what needs to be customized in a language that hosts the potential customer should be or keep it in English and it’s sufficient? \r\n Laszlo Horvath: It’s a very good question. The answer is both. As you know, English is not one language. In our practice, English is one version is the North American version that we speak here. The other one is the U.K. English and then there is the Australian English and then there are all kinds of international English versions there as well that have to be taken into consideration. \r\n So depending on your needs, you may consider a multi-language optimization in English and in addition to that, if you look at the size of your markets in different foreign areas, Spanish is a huge market online. China itself has over a hundred million online users. \r\n There are huge markets in Europe. The EU is a fragmented marketplace that you can target using international English to a large extent with the exception of France where you need to do the French language optimization. Germany uses equally German and English. Spain has to be done in Spanish. \r\n Italian if your market is appropriate for that market so depending on your priorities, start with multi-lingual English optimization, the different versions of the English language because that’s the easiest. \r\n And after you have warmed-up to optimization in English, then you can enter one of the largest international markets and continue from there because search engines give an unfair competitive advantage to the local language sites if you have let’s say a targeted marketing program for Spain, if your Website is hosted in Spain and it’s in Spanish, you come up way ahead of competitors that have a generic site in English. \r\n (Elizabeth Donnelly): Okay. Thank you. \r\n Laszlo Horvath: My pleasure. \r\n Coordinator: I show no other questions at this time. \r\n Roza Pace: Okay, can you hear me, operator? \r\n Coordinator: Yes, I can hear you. \r\n Roza Pace: Yes, yes, hello. Yes, and a question that perhaps I have to either of the speakers is many of the listeners may be representatives of small and medium-sized companies and the question that I have, what would you recommend advice in terms of resources that they should spend on both social media as well as Website optimization? \r\n Is this something that they should tackle by themselves in-house or should they consider external players to help them with or both or it depends and so any comments that you can have on that and especially it applies to international sales. \r\n Like for instance, you know, you mentioned Chinese markets. You have a Baidu as opposed to Google. How do you make yourselves visible there in China? Do you use Baidu or what and so thank you. \r\n (Larry Smith): Well, since you have asked the search engines Roza particularly in China, the search engine optimization process is when you target the Chinese market, we are targeting the Chinese Baidu search engine algorithm so it needs to be in Chinese so obviously if you want to serve that marketplace, you need someone in-house who is we call that the champion of that market. \r\n And that particular person has to speak Chinese to understand the intricacies of that marketplace. Otherwise you are going to get a lot of disappointed potential customers coming to you and not getting the right quality answers. \r\n Often times we get the question shall we use Google’s translator software? That’s a very good solution for short-term ad hoc immediate needs but please do not rely on technology alone without the human resources to target a significant market. \r\n So the answer to the question is you need to allocate resources that are market-specific so if you are targeting let’s say Latin America, you need someone who is a foreign speaker in that marketplace. \r\n And the resources that you have to allocate to this, a search engine optimization is not that expensive because essentially after you did a search engine optimization program, you just maintain your visibility so you don’t need to spend a lot of money. \r\n Pay-per-click is a little bit more expensive and social media expenditure depends on the penetration of the social media space in that particular country. For example in Brazil, I can’t see a digital marketing program without the social media components since they are one of the leaders in social media visibility. \r\n In other countries that are less advanced in that field, you may get by with an aggressive search engine optimization program followed by pay-per-click or social media, depending on your budget because in an ideal case scenario, if you are a small company you want to have a return on your investment that helps you finance future needs. \r\n And that’s why if you apply the online marketing pyramid and start with the search engine optimization, you essentially get the lowest possible investment and you get the highest return for that and then you move on to the next level and then to the next level. \r\n Roza Pace: Thank you very much, (Larry). \r\n (Larry Smith): My pleasure. \r\n Roza Pace: Now I just wanted in the meantime while we may wait for a couple additional questions just to let you know that Commerce-wide you could follow us using social media. There is a blog at the http://blog.trade.gov. You could follow us on Twitter. I will send you the links to that. \r\n You could also - there’s an important, you know, aspect of selling online Internet using social media - that we could not find some information and hopefully is useful information on our expert.gov Website when you go to export.gov/sellingonline. \r\n There are different things to think about. One thing that we were not discussing today, we assume that you do have a good Website, that it’s exciting and interesting because to optimize Website without good Website is not particularly necessarily helpful. \r\n Again so you have to have your strategy and presence which is independent of the tactics as we were talking about too. Now don’t know if we have any other questions here. If you have any additional questions, feel free to call us and contact us and contact our speakers. \r\n And we’ll send you e-mail with the presentations as well as with the recording of the presentation in case you have additional questions and here in a tick we can help you with not only this topic but if you have any questions related to any aspect of exporting all the way from how to find your agents, buyers, distributors, how what kind of expert documentation you need, you need to find out about a lot of export-related events and we do have a presence in every state here as well as in almost 80 different countries. \r\n So we’re one big networking organization in addition to other sort of services that we can provide to exporting companies so if you just remember export.gov and 1-800-USA-TRADE, we’ll either have an answer for you or we’ll connect you with someone who does have an answer and thank you again to the speakers and to everyone who dialed-in. Thanks. \r\n END \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-13","title":"Using eCommerce and Social Media to Expand Sales Overseas","update_date":"2013-05-15","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["E-Commerce"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["Marketing Strategy","social media"]},{"id":"478","content":" In this webinar, you will learn about export compliance obligations for commercial encryption technology items.

Thank you for joining us for our Webinar on the Basic Guide to Exporting: Improving Your Cultural Intelligence. I’m Roza Pace, a Senior International Trade Specialist with the Trade Information Center. The Trade Information Center is part of the U.S. Commercial Service at the Department of Commerce. Our mission is to help U.S. Companies export. \r\n I’d like to welcome all the U.S. Commercial Service clients and other Webinar participants in our exporting community who are joining us from all across the U.S. to learn about this very important topic. \r\n We very happy to note that today we have a very diverse assortment of participants and we hope you will find today’s Webinar of interest. Please note that this is an audio recording. We hope that you will have in front of you PowerPoint presentation that was sent to you separately and during this session we will discuss the cultural IQ template and through the discussion we’ll link to our own intercultural communication experiences. \r\n The discussion will be led by Mr. - by Dr. Doug Barry - our Senior International Trade Specialist with the Department of Commerce.

Now without further ado, Doug, welcome and have a wonderful Webinar experience. \r\n Doug Barry: Great. Thank you very much, folks, and thank you Roza. Just to remind you, this was a sort of unusual two-part Webinar. The first part which was recorded in June by the author of the book Improving Your Cultural Intelligence Dr. David Livermore was sent out to those who registered. \r\n It’s not a prerequisite to have this in front of you in order to get hopefully a lot out of the discussion that we’re going to have today and we can certainly send you his presentation as soon as this is over. If you e-mail us, we’ll be happy to provide that to you. It is online. \r\n Today though you don’t need to look at anything in order to gain from the session. You just simply listen to your fellow participants who will be asking questions in a bit and I’ll give a brief presentation for five minutes at the top of the program. \r\n And then after that I will ask for your questions and comments both on what I’m going to speak about in a minute, your own intercultural communication experiences and anything that you took away from the Webinar by Dr. Livermore. \r\n Who by the way would have been here himself today except he was called away on short notice. I think he’s in Thailand at this moment where it is probably 2:00 in the morning and he was working quite late and was unable to be with us today. \r\n So let me after welcoming you just to talk a little bit about the topic of cultural intelligence, how to develop it and how intercultural challenges that I’m sure we have all had that you are facing now or will face in the future can be enriched by the work of Dr. Livermore and his colleagues. \r\n He has really provided a framework to help us think about how to think about the role of culture in our everyday life with a particular emphasis on business and I’m assuming that you phoned-in today because you believe that culture is an important element in doing international business. \r\n And that there are particular skills you can learn to assist in your interactions with people from different cultures, and the culture does matter. And my takeaway from the book and the presentation by Dr. Livermore is that you can’t learn all you need to know by reading the equivalence of those Lonely Planet guides to Nepal or Thailand or China that he talked about in his presentation. \r\n Though the do’s and don’ts and taboos book do have a place in our acquisition of this knowledge and this set of skills, they also have a lot of limitations and by themselves are not adequate to help us learn what we need to know in order to be effective intercultural communicators. \r\n Now I remember reading such a book, the do’s and taboos before an assignment that I had a few years ago in Thailand and one of the things I remember, it warned me not to show the bottoms of my shoes to Thai people and not to touch them on the head. \r\n And so I thought okay, this is useful, so I went to Bangkok and I was there for awhile and I asked a Thai coworker about these injunctions and this is what she said. She said, “Yes, these things are offensive to us” and then I thought aha, this is very useful. They’re right. \r\n I’ve now tried it out on a relative young person so it’s nothing that is necessarily age-related. It’s true throughout the culture in large part and then she asked me when was the last time in a meeting with business people did I pat a customer on the head or raised my legs up in order to show them the bottoms of my feet while sitting at the meeting table. \r\n And to tell you the truth I couldn’t remember the last time I did that. I don’t think I ever did that so reading the cultural sensitivity literature before your next intercultural encounter is part of the strategy that Dr. Livermore’s research suggests you do. \r\n But there is much, much more and I like the way that he talks of acquiring CQ or cultural intelligence as part of a process that involves examining your behavior as much as it does examining the behavior of others not like you and most importantly learning from both of these things. \r\n Now by way of kicking things off, let me briefly share a personal story, how it might be seen through the cultural intelligence framework and what it might say about my cultural intelligence or lack of it. \r\n Now I’ll confess that I’ve loved traveling since I was a little kid though I didn’t do much traveling then. I didn’t get out of the State of California until I was I think 21 but I always imagined and I dreamed about going places and I had a secret plan to go places when I had the money and the freedom in order to do it. \r\n And I liked learning about and from other cultures and I grew up in a very cultural (polyglot) of San Francisco and the 1960s and 1970s. Now I’ll confess also that my parents and grandparents whom I was very close to were I suppose varying degrees of racist. \r\n My grandmother, San Franciscan at the beginning of the last century, this puts it, you know, in late 1890s and the early part of the next century, fondly remember and told me this, you know, as a child chasing Chinese kids through the streets of San Francisco and pulling their queue or the little pigtail which they still wore at that time. \r\n And it’s clear, she didn’t like them and she didn’t like them because they were Chinese. So I smiled during the last years of her life when she was cared for at her home by a Chinese-American woman who my grandfather - my grandmother - so, you know, not completely in her right mind at the time, loved as if she was one of her own children. \r\n So I would not have selected any of my relatives to represent my company in international business dealings, not from what I know. And without talking to him further would I select the NPR - I should say former NPR commentator - Juan Williams who you may have heard about in the news who was fired by NPR after he voiced fears of getting on airplanes with people who looked like Muslims. \r\n Now I think giving voice to personal prejudices is an important part of examining what Dr. Livermore calls drive, the reason behind one’s desire to acquire cultural intelligence. But stereotypes and how they develop must be part of the process of ongoing self-reflection and that is why do I hold these beliefs, how did they develop and what factual basis supports them? \r\n And if none does, how can I change them? I’m different than my family members and probably different from Juan Williams. I’ve visited Muslim countries. I’ve visited mosques here in the Washington, D.C. area where I’m speaking to you today and I’m aware of the manipulative nature and power of the mass media. \r\n And I try to take precautions against indoctrination by that media just as I do in warding off infections and viruses. Doing so daily is part of what Dr. Livermore calls strategy. \r\n So now let me tell you another little story that brings us up to contemporary times and if you listen to the recording by Dr. Livermore, I was one of his questioners and I asked about how to prevent myself from doing stupid things in my relations with the Japanese people. \r\n And let me just sort of quickly say that I had dinner with a Japanese man that I’ve known for many years. He’s quite a high-level, highly-respected individual in Japanese cultural, political, educational, diplomatic circles. \r\n He came to Washington, D.C. almost a year ago today and he called me up and invited me to a very nice hotel in downtown Washington for dinner. We had a great dinner and then during the course of the conversation we had a discussion about a project, one that I had proposed to him and he was very, very excited about this and he thought oh, this was great. \r\n We talked in very specific terms. He left. I e-mailed him a week or so later with some even more specific proposals about this project. He was equally enthusiastic and said okay, you know, send me additional details, budget and so forth which I did. \r\n And then a week later I got an e-mail from him which seemed to suggest oh, we’ve gone, you know, way too far. We’re way ahead of where I feel comfortable being. I have to discuss this with my colleagues. They’re saying there’s no time to do this in their workplans and we just need to take time out. I need to consult and then I’ll get back to you. \r\n And then the next time was even vaguer and the next time vaguer still until he wasn’t talking about it at all in these communications and I was, you know, frustrated. I thought, you know, we had a deal; what happened? \r\n And I was just about ready to send him an e-mail that would have I think destroyed the entire relationship and I thought about it for awhile and I decided not to send it and so the relationship is still ongoing but the proximity to disaster troubled me very deeply because I thought I knew a lot about Japanese culture. \r\n I thought I knew a lot about Japanese people, personality, character, psychology. I’d studied it. I’d been there, had Japanese friends. And I just wondered why none of that seemed to inform me at all and to prevent me from almost making a terrible blunder that would have ruined that relationship which is both personal and professional. \r\n So I made a number - when I thought about this in sort of a triage or critique of what had happened - I had a number of implicit assumptions which are unexamined thoughts and beliefs which motivate action. In this case, you know, I didn’t examine these assumptions. \r\n I didn’t even know I was having them. I didn’t identify them so how I could know about them until after the near-disaster and here are some of the assumptions. \r\n And I’m laying out some of these assumptions now because I think the implicit assumption identification is a part of Dr. Livermore’s framework that while he doesn’t talk about them specifically, he implies such a process in a couple of the steps in his four-part model. \r\n This in particular is sort of, you know, the research that you do beforehand and then the plan that you develop and the execution of the plan. So the assumption that I made was that because I have been interacting with Japanese for years, I could trust my judgment in each of the future encounters I would have with them. \r\n And I further assumed that because this person spoke fluent English and seemed comfortable with non-Japanese people that he wasn’t as Japanese as other Japanese I had known or read about and was therefore free of the codes, the rules, the behaviors and the rituals that are associated with very Japanese kinds of behavior. \r\n And free of these things I assumed further that I could talk frankly ala American upfrontness, even pointing out how unproductive Japanese behavior would be in this situation. \r\n And that was predicated on a further assumption that this person was the ultimate boss and could summarily order his minions to do his bidding based on what I thought was a shared understanding of what that bidding was. \r\n Now because these assumptions were never made explicit and examined by me, I nearly blundered and potentially lost a friend as well as future professional opportunities. I really had no strategy based on the identification of these assumptions other than getting the deal done on my American-style timeframe. \r\n But if you heard Dr. Livermore, he opined that my intelligence - cultural intelligence - kicked-in somewhere during this process and prevented me from sending the e-mails and destroying the relationship. \r\n That I did pull up just short of disaster was not a cause for celebration but wonderment on how previous lessons and knowledge can be unreflectively switched off, leaving one partially blinded by the power of their own cultural norms. \r\n I now have a strategy which takes the reflections into account and makes the assumptions as you heard explicit and so with this Japanese friend, I will contact him periodically by e-mail. \r\n I will raise the project only at the end of the e-mail and only in the most general and gentle terms and I will incorporate what I’ve learned about the process of Japanese decision-making and Japanese concepts of time into the execution of the strategy which at this point is exclusively a communication strategy. \r\n And you know, with the Japanese and Dr. Livermore mentioned this, you know, time is a very important aspect of intercultural understanding and communication because different societies operate on different timeframes so I’m in a big hurry to get things done. \r\n Others want relationships to develop slowly and completely before they feel comfortable before entering into an economic arrangement with you and in the Japanese side of things, they’re probably a mix of both but they do like to get to know you and they don’t want to be hurried. \r\n And indeed, you know, they’ve sometimes used in the literature that is - this never happened to me I don’t think - but in the literature you will find anthropologists and others talking about people from other culture using knowledge of another culture that’s not their own as a sort of a counterweight or as an effective strategy against the other negotiating party. \r\n And there’s been stories that I’m aware of, have read in the literature where Americans come and they say I’m going to be here for five days. And you know, I hope at the end of the five days - and they imply at the end of the five days I’d like to have a contract, I’d like to have an agreement and, you know, an exchange of protocols about making a purchase. \r\n And so the people who they’re attempting to sell things to realize that okay, their flight is on Friday and that means if I can delay things and create pressure and tension, they’ll want to make a deal before they go. And because they’re in a hurry, they may make concessions that they wouldn’t make if time were not such an issue. \r\n We have a different concept of time. Time is on our side in this case. They’ve indicated that it’s not on their side and so let’s use time to enhance our position at the expense of their position and then as far as the deliberative decision-making, the Japanese, you know, like to include a lot of people in the decision. \r\n They want to get buy-in from everybody and it doesn’t matter, you know, what the status of the people are in the organization. There’s just a lot of discussion about whether or not to move forward on something and it can take quite a long time for that to happen. \r\n It sounds a little bit like the federal government here in Washington so I should, you know, not only have the experience of living and working in Japan but also here in the federal government and I ought to be very much familiar with this process but I wasn’t. \r\n I wanted to rush things into being and I switched off that understanding that there is this collaborative decision-making, consensus decision-making. The word in Japanese is (nemawashi) and I even thought at one point I would use that in my communication. \r\n Well they might say I know this is (nemawashi) but (nemawashi) really, you know, has not served the Japanese corporate world very well, has it. And you can imagine how good such a slight - not intended to be one - but nevertheless received that way, he probably would be deeply offended but would never tell me and that would be the end of it. \r\n In other words, I wanted - I had an impulse - to lecture him on what doesn’t work in Japanese business culture from my perspective and use that to help him understand that there are different ways of doing things and that he should do it my way and not his way. And right away you see the quicksand that I had jumped into there and fortunately I didn’t do any of those things. \r\n And so I have a process that includes the knowledge component, that is, the kinds of things that I will draw upon in my own experience to inform what I’m going to do next and to understanding how to communicate. \r\n I’ll have a strategy and I’ll have a plan to execute the strategy using the knowledge about myself and all of those shortcomings that I’ve just laid out for you and the Japanese that I have developed over time. \r\n And as part of the knowledge and strategy, you know, there are many resources that I and you can depend on. One of course is Dr. Livermore himself who has asked you to e-mail him anytime with your questions, concerns and comments, that he will reply to you. \r\n You can of course refer to his book which has a lot of practical tips and suggestions about how you can develop these capabilities and reflective capabilities. \r\n Certainly you can contact me. You can contact my colleagues here at the Trade Information Center with questions about cultural communication and you can certainly talk and we’ll refer you to our colleagues around the world who represent most of the cultural groups you will be doing business with or want to do business with. \r\n And then of course there are the representatives of these cultural groups in your own communities that also provide you with a resource that you can easily tap into. \r\n So with that opening statement and in particular trying to take a recent experience that’s still raw in my mind and reinterpret it in Dr. Livermore’s, you know, four major areas of this structure for cultural intelligence that he has provided us, I would like for you now to think about for a minute cultural encounters that you have had. \r\n How you’ve dealt with them successfully or unsuccessfully, see if you can, you know, twin them with what Dr. Livermore has laid out if you choose to do that or just share an insight that you have had that suggests, you know, the development of your cultural intelligence. \r\n So let’s open the lines up now for comments and discussion. It’s now about 27 past the hour. We can go to the top of the next hour and that gives us about 35 or 40 minutes for a discussion. Thanks again for your attention and let’s have the discussion. \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. \r\n Your name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your request, press star 2. One moment while we wait for the first question or comment. (Donald Ellison), your line is now open. \r\n (Donald Ellison): Hi. You mentioned some of the experiences we had. I remember in my young business career I had a colleague - an older colleague - that informed me that he had an excellent contact at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. and that I should utilize that individual. \r\n So I called him up, showed up at the Embassy, started my discussion and I noticed the individual was very nervous and I didn’t quite know how to deal with it but we continued. \r\n Later on I found that he was an interpreter not a person that could conduct business and he was very nervous because he didn’t know as an interpreter why he was asked to participate or to be the contact person. \r\n So you have to be careful and make sure you do your homework just like you have to be careful when you go into a U.S. Company. Because the U.S. Company, you need to get to know the gatekeepers, whether it’s the secretary, you need to know the corporate culture and so forth so that was an experience that I found has always stuck with me. \r\n Doug Barry: Yes, that’s a very good observation, and yes, you get a reference from a person that you trust which is part of our culture. And here maybe is a great pathway into the Chinese Embassy and the expertise that exists there but you have no way of independently verifying whether what your friend told you is really accurate and it turned out not to be. \r\n And the Chinese I think are very aware of status. They’re also very aware of what that status allows them to do in terms of talking to people who are not part of the Embassy community or if it was a Chinese business, the business itself. \r\n And so finding out who the right person is to talk to is extremely important and I think to try to, you know, relate that to Dr. Livermore’s cultural intelligence template, this seems to be, you know, the knowledge that, you know, what knowledge do I need? \r\n What information do I need in order to satisfy my objective which is to create I guess in your case contacts within the Embassy that can provide you some insight into a possible business opportunity there. \r\n And so then, you know, to be able to ask yourself what information do I need, obviously I need contacts at the Embassy but the first contact you get may not be the one that you follow-up on and that there may be some additional steps to take. One is to call the Chinese specialist at the Department of Commerce who all have their own contacts at the Embassy. \r\n They would be happy to tell you what those individuals know and maybe even, you know, offer to make an introduction to you which in a lot of Asian societies and a lot of non-Asian societies, an introduction is extremely important and who does the introducing is just as important. \r\n And so the more effort that you can put in on finding the right person even if it takes a few weeks and requires some phone calls, that is time well worth spent. \r\n (Donald Ellison): I might follow-up on that also when you emphasized the importance of working with the excellent resources we have within the U.S. government, a number of years later I was in charge of a trade association and we had some USDA money to help out with some of the trade shows we were doing overseas. \r\n And I had to go into a country, make sure all the trade show exhibits and so forth were moved into the country, set-up and ready to go but when the company marketing people and representatives would arrive and then I would close things down and make it to the next country. \r\n Well in one particular case I was having major problems getting our materials through the Customs and working with the Embassy, they sent down one of the local people and he was able to bridge some of the cultural problems because he was a local native and was able to get the materials through. \r\n Whereas a carton of cigarettes I couldn’t have passed on, he was able to and saved a major disaster. \r\n Doug Barry: Right, again knowing the right person but even beyond that, there are some very specific things that are worth knowing about Germans and German business culture and to be able to research that before you go would be very helpful. \r\n They’re much more formal at these trade shows than U.S. trade shows. By that I mean dress, I mean the way that they refer to each other. There’s also the, you know, very interesting sort of social culture there at these trade shows that involves beer and Oktoberfest-like festivals and to know about that in advance and how to conduct yourself when you’re there can be very valuable. \r\n And by the way, there’s an excellent video series on YouTube. I think you use the keywords international or German trade show. They that and there are five parts to it. They’re each about five or six minutes and they take you through the, you know, international trade shows using the German ones as an example and there’s a couple of segments on culture that are quite fascinating. \r\n And if you can’t find this on YouTube, e-mail me and I’ll send you the links to it and I appreciate your comments and thanks very much. Have a good day and now we’ll open the line to the next question. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Jacob Nixon). Your line is now open. \r\n Doug Barry: Hello, (Jacob). \r\n (Jacob Nixon): Hi, Doug. This is (Jacob Nixon) at the Trade Information Center. Based on your previous experience in the international world of business and also in your interactions with Dr. Livermore, in general what do you recommend an agent of a U.S. Company do when you’re having business with a potential buyer face-to-face in a new country that maybe they haven’t had a presence in in the past? \r\n Doug Barry: Well, that’s a good question. You know, first, you know, I would have a plan going in and the plan would include before I got there to learn as much about that particular culture as I can and as, you know, Dr. Livermore said, it’s not always straightforward. \r\n If you go to a place in the Middle East for example, say Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, you might be at a table with people who are Germans, Chinese, Koreans and maybe there would be someone there from Saudi Arabia, a Saudi Arabian and so, you know, you may need to know that in advance. Who is it that I’m meeting with? Inquire before you get there, who’s going to be there? \r\n Can you send bios of the people? The Japanese are or were - I haven’t been there in a couple of years - very big on learning as much as they can about who’s going to be in the meeting with them and they will always ask please send us the bio of everyone who’s going to be there. \r\n And they will study it carefully and they’ll memorize, you know, various aspects of the person’s background so that they can, you know, use it in discussion. But also they can get a sense of who this person is, what their title is, what the title signifies in terms of the, you know, the power that they have to make decisions on behalf of the company. \r\n So that would be one thing in doing the homework and then find out as much as you can about the country. Look at and then obviously if you don’t - if you’re fearful - about going to the Middle East for whatever reason, if you have bad associations with people in the Middle East, then you might ask someone else to go. \r\n You know, know enough about yourself and your own concerns, biases and so forth, stereotypes. Be honest and, you know, ask yourself. Keep a diary. Keep a journal in which these things can be written down and you can have an honest discussion with yourself about, you know, what might affect your ability to be successful as a representative of your company going to one of these places. \r\n Then when you’re there, try to notice as much as you can about what’s going on there, how people fit, how they’re addressed, who’s the quieter, who’s the more, you know, conversational. Think about your own, you know, communication style. \r\n If someone goes into the meeting with you, have them observe these things and take notes because you may be too busy trying to, you know, put your thoughts together and if you’re working through a translator or an interpreter, that would be, you know, another thing to multitask. \r\n And you may not be so observant but someone else with you could be and then after debrief. What happened there? What did you see? What did I see and what might this mean for our next and future encounter? \r\n And then after the meeting, you know, there are of course ritualistic responses, thank you very - make sure they get the thank you letters - make sure you address them properly. Better to err on the side of formality than informality. \r\n Mohammad would probably not work but, you know, Mr. Sheikh or whatever would probably be more appropriate and these are things that you would know ahead of time and then you can plan your next communication, your next interaction with them based on these observations and what you’ve all put together in terms of the plan that you have developed. \r\n And I think, you know, those before, during and after steps while, you know, very general and cursory probably will stand you in good stead. \r\n (Jacob Nixon): Thanks, Doug. \r\n Doug Barry: Thank you, (Jacob). Next question? \r\n Coordinator: I show no further questions and again if you do have any questions or comments, please press star 1 and record your name. Again, please press star 1. \r\n Doug Barry: Great. We can wait just a couple of minutes and be happy to take more questions from you. This is a good discussion. Again if you had a cultural communication encounter that went very well, let us know. If you had one that didn’t go so well or left you a little bit quizzical, tell us about that. \r\n And any questions about the Dr. Livermore cultural intelligence model, feel free to ask those and go to his Website where apparently there is a tool or a survey that helps you measure your own cultural intelligence as the research of his group has indicated. \r\n You can sort of tell where you are on a scale and let you know, you know, where you might need to go in the future or, you know, how terrific you are now as a cultural communicator. \r\n Roza Pace: Doug, this is Roza. I’d like to follow-up with a question and perhaps also a comment. I’d like to hear from you your take on any specific advice that you might have for women in international trade. \r\n Obviously all the wonderful points that were made by Mr. Livermore and yourself are very applicable to an agenda; however, I notice when I for instance traveled a lot to countries which are a little different than ours, let’s say, I remember very distinctly my experience of business travel to Pakistan. \r\n And it was one of the receptions, I met this woman who was a very successful businesswoman working for major power company in the U.K. and her company was actually very successful in the international procurement field in Pakistan. They were overseeing number of power projects there. \r\n And I asked her how she manages to be so successful in a Muslim environment knowing that she was not herself of this particular background and she said well, I just learned about the realities of the world and I know in this country women unfortunately at least from professional angle do not count as men. \r\n So what I do, I breathe and I take with my assistants who don’t have the same title and may not have the same knowledge but I let them speak and tell them exactly what to tell and succeed that way. \r\n I thought this was a little different but obviously worked in this particular case and of course dress code was a separate issue too in a country like Pakistan or the Middle East. Being a woman you want to be very mindful of being dressed respectfully but anyway any thoughts that you might have, that would be quite appreciated too. \r\n Doug Barry: Yes. That’s an excellent question Roza and, you know, I don’t pretend to be an expert in the women’s styles of intercultural communication but I think that the story that you conveyed makes a lot of sense. \r\n And I certainly have read similar kinds of cases where high-level, you know, Western women will in fact bring others along with them through whom they can deal or with whom they can deal mainly as a way of setting the potential buyers and business partners at ease. \r\n And I guess my feeling would be, you know, be pragmatic. What is your goal going into it? If the goal is to, you know, secure a sale or substantial business from a country with a culture that’s substantially different than ours particularly in gender relations, then that should drive the strategy as to who goes and who presents. \r\n I do think though that the world is changing and what may have been true, you know, a few years ago is less true today particularly since a lot of these Muslim countries where the dominant religion is Islam, you know, they’re changing too. \r\n The King of Saudi Arabia has made it a point to, you know, increase the inclusivity of women at all stages of society and there’s a lot of opposition to his plans but he seems determined as is his family on this course. \r\n And I think Saudi Arabia which is one of the most traditional societies I think in the region and in the world will be very different in this respect in five years than it is now. \r\n So I think let the pragmatism be your guide, knowing if you are a high-level executive in a company and you are a woman, you know, there are different ways of finessing this and by all means, you will get some cues obviously from the people who are hosting you and other, you know, discreet questions can be asked. \r\n And you can of course contact we have an Embassy in Pakistan with both Pakistani employees and Americans who’ve been there for a long time and they would be more than helpful to advise you and it probably could be on a case-by-case basis. \r\n Understand that it is a factor in play but it does depend on each particular circumstance, each group of people. There’s knowledge. This is the earlier question about, you know, who do you deal with, who can speak for the organization that you want to be in contact with? \r\n Spend a little time on the front end making the inquiries and it will go much better when it’s time to meet people in person. \r\n Roza Pace: That’s good advice, Doug. \r\n Doug Barry: Thank you so much. Any other questions? \r\n Coordinator: (Brian Ruff), your line is now open. \r\n (Brian Ruff): Hi. I’m sorry, I joined a little late you might have (unintelligible). I was just wondering if you have any recommendations on specific literature regarding dealing with, you know, business meetings and cultures. Maybe specific by region or country such as dress, the type of dress you’d wear, the type of salutations you’d use, you know, the type of conversation that you might have, you know, specifically with countries in Asia or in Middle East or something like that. \r\n Is there any specific literature that you would recommend or it’s just like a general broad research? \r\n Doug Barry: Sure, good question. Well, you know, I’m quite fond of Dr. Livermore’s book which I read some months ago and that is the cultural intelligence book which I definitely is worth reading, getting out of the library or purchasing online. \r\n There’s a chapter in the Basic Guide to Exporting on intercultural communication and business culture which is very worthwhile. That’s good and then I think it’s Roger Axtell, seems to me that he was the author of the Do’s and Taboos of International Business. \r\n And it’s one of those books about, you know, don’t touch people on the head but, you know, there are hundreds of observations like that that apply to different cultures and societies, the formalities, how to address people. \r\n And then another resource that is free is the Country Commercial Guide they’re called or short CCG, Country Commercial Guide and there’s one for every country in the world where we have a diplomatic presence and you can get them on export.gov under the market research section in the market research library. \r\n You just type-in the country that you want the research on and it will give you this entire thing. It’s probably a hundred-page document for every country and there’s a section in there on business culture and I think those would be very useful. \r\n And of course, you know, you remember the terrible stories that have been told about awful blunders in advertising when it comes to trying to sell things in other countries. \r\n The blunder that a maker of laundry detergent made some time ago in the Middle East where they had a poster campaign on the highways. And the intent of it was to show a gray, you know, outfit, the long white robes that are worn there by men and women, you know, they’re very gray to start with and if you use this product, they’ll turn out sparkling white. \r\n But in the Arabic language, you read things from right to left, not left to right so the posters were put up in the English-speaking world way and so the message to the people driving past on the Saudi desert was that this product will turn your robes to gray. \r\n And you know, then there was the Nova, N-O-V-A, the GM vehicle 10-15 years ago when it was introduced to Latin America without any change of name. “No va” in Spanish means “no go” so no one’s going to buy a car with a name like that or maybe a few people would but most wouldn’t. \r\n And then it’s not just us that makes these blunders, there was a company in Spain that rolled-out an anti-acne medication and they named it Zit, Z-I-T. So you know, these things are done, and of course we’re all appalled by them thinking that millions of dollars worth of marketing could just go down the drain because of some foolish mistake that no one caught. \r\n But I think the good news is that you can only seize on a few of these blunders. Most of the time, people seem to get it right because they do care, they do their homework and, you know, they understand enough about the culture not to make this horrible mistake. \r\n So there’s a few bits, a few referrals from the literature, particularly the free research that we do and I think you’ll be well-served to thank a look at them. \r\n (Brian Ruff): Okay, definitely. Thanks. \r\n Doug Barry: Thank you for your question. Anyone else? Please, we have a few more minutes and certainly time for let’s see at least one question, maybe two more or a comment. \r\n Coordinator: (Joey Rosenberg), your line is now open. \r\n Doug Barry: Hello, (Joey). \r\n Coordinator: Please check your mute button. \r\n (Joey Rosenberg): I’m sorry, can you hear me now? \r\n Doug Barry: Yes, I can. \r\n (Joey Rosenberg): Great, sorry about that. My question comes to you from having been an experienced traveler. I’ve been to many of the world’s regions and find that I feel very comfortable studying culture in advance and then sort of testing what I’ve learned here adequately on the ground and adapting. \r\n But I’m wondering if a company is looking to expand to a new market altogether, how much time should be invested in trying to employ or make connections, either consulting connections or otherwise on the ground in the new market before they sort of try to take a stab at increasing their own cultural knowledge and going there? \r\n I’m wondering how much of that connection and capacity-building on the ground should be built into that four-step plan that was in the pre-slides about your action and strategy. \r\n Doug Barry: Right. Well, let’s see. That’s an excellent question and I think, you know, I think that it depends on, you know, if you’re going to be hiring staff in the country, if how complicated your product is and the extent to which, you know, it might need to be modified in some way because of the way the culture uses the product as opposed to its use say in its home market or the market where it was created, maybe the United States. \r\n So those things, you know, need to be accounted for and then the other part is, you know, how if you know absolutely nothing about this, obviously, you know, you’re going to want to know if the thing will sell under any conditions whether it’s modified or not in this particular place. \r\n Now, you know, you can learn a great deal from people in initial conversations with them and the Department of Commerce of course has a service where, you know, you engage the people at the Embassy, tell them what you want. \r\n They go out into the marketplace. They find people who are interested in this and then they arrange for several different potential buyers to come to the Embassy to meet you when you go down there. \r\n And then, you know, they make a presentation to you on their capabilities, you make a presentation to them on your capabilities and then you have a conversation about whether the product - I mean, the product is likely to at that point already passed the vetting stage where there is interest. \r\n People think yes, it will sell here. Maybe, you know, you’ll need to create an operation here. It’ll just make it much easier for you or maybe we through, you know, a distributorship can handle everything. \r\n And then you get into a discussion at some point. Usually it’s you the decision-maker going down there and you will learn some very useful things about the adaptation of the product in the market. \r\n One case that I wrote about a year or so ago involved a very - it was a - I think it was some kind of a exercise machine for rehabilitation purposes that had been built by this company in Iowa. And they went to I think Japan which is a tough market to sell things in because they’ve very, very critical of things that are not made in Japan. \r\n And what they learned from the Japanese was the seat is too big for them and if they made the seat smaller, it would sell and so they went back and this is sort of an interesting insight too. \r\n As Dr. Livermore talked about, you know, flexibility, mental flexibility, personality flexibility, being part of this sort of, you know, profile of people who tend to be better than others at intercultural intelligence and communication. \r\n And so of course taking this advice from your potential buyer, going back and making those modifications is an example of being flexible but it’s also an example of listening very carefully to people and taking back and wanting to improve the product so it will not only sell there but it will sell in other places. \r\n So you know, you can learn a lot just from those initial interactions but they’re of course choreographed. You’ve got people working for you in the Embassy there who are setting all this stuff up. They’re informing you about cultural aspects then you have an opportunity to, you know, talk to the people who are interested in buying your product. They will inform you further. \r\n You go to the stores. You watch, you observe. You sit on the street corner as it sounds like you’ve done that very well in your travels and you make notes of the behavior of people and all the while you’re saying this is different, this is different, this is similar. This is so interesting, you know, I can’t wait to get back and, you know, apply what I’ve learned here. \r\n And so all of those things together, you know, I think can increase the likelihood of you being successful and at the same time suggest the amount of effort and time you need to put in on the front end. \r\n Now saying that, you could get a call tomorrow from a buyer in another country who sees your products online and wants to buy it, you know, sight unseen and it doesn’t have anything to do with culture much although, you know, certainly you in your Website presentation can take into account what you know or can find out about an international buyer. \r\n That they might want some kind of welcoming text in English saying, you know, we do serve international buyers and we’re delighted to have them here and here’s an example of, you know, a buyer in blank in Switzerland that was very, you know, that liked our product. \r\n Or you can have a page in German or Spanish or wherever people are likely to come from welcoming them or the whole site, all the pages and the catalog of things that you have can be translated into different languages which shows that you’re ready to do business internationally. \r\n You appreciate that not everyone is going to be fluent in English and therefore you’re going to provide them the service so that they will feel comfortable in dealing with you. Is that helpful? \r\n (Joey Rosenberg): Yes, thank you. \r\n Doug Barry: Great. Thank you for the question. Okay, who else do we have? This is great, by the way. Great questions. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Donald Ellison). Your line is now open. \r\n Doug Barry: All right. Hello, (Donald). \r\n (Donald Ellison): Hi. On your June 16, 2010 broadcast that Dr. Livermore made, he said that - I don’t know, the version that was the moderator Mr. (Hill) - said that if you participated in two of the - signed-up for two of the or more of the - advance to your Webinars, you’d receive a complimentary copy of the Basic Guide to Exporting. \r\n Doug Barry: Yes. \r\n (Donald Ellison): Is that still valid? \r\n Doug Barry: Yes, it is valid today only ladies and gentlemen. If you send me a quick e-mail after, we’ll put one in the mail to you and those who are listening now, if you have also signed-up for more than one and are with us today, send me a quick e-mail, Doug, D-O-U-G dot Barry, B-A-R-R-Y at trade, T-R-A-D-E dot gov and we’ll make sure you get a book. \r\n (Donald Ellison): Thank you. That was very productive for me to ask that question. \r\n Doug Barry: Yes, it was. Was this helpful to you, this session and the other with Dr. Livermore? \r\n (Donald Ellison): Oh, without question. And it confirms a lot of things that I’ve learned over the years. You mentioned as an example making sure that you know your audience when you get there. \r\n We were taking in a series of meetings and one of them that we had not planned for was introduced by one of the individuals that we were working with and we got there, it was in Brazil. \r\n We didn’t know Portuguese. They didn’t know English but we both had people that knew German so they conversed in German and then went back to each side and explained what was happening at that point. \r\n Doug Barry: Very practical, very inventive and unexpected but nevertheless, it worked out and hopefully the sale was made and good business was conducted. \r\n (Donald Ellison): Well, the irony was the German - or the American - that knew German, when he would turn back to us, he’d continue speaking in German because that was his native language and he’d forget. We’d have to say okay, time to speak in English. \r\n Doug Barry: That’s right, well learning these languages is very important and, you know, I have an 11-year-old daughter who’s started learning Chinese and so hopefully when she’s in high school, she’ll go on an exchange and after that she’ll be fluent at some point down the road. \r\n And, you know, I’d definitely recommend that you, you know, learn a few phrases before you go abroad and/or just a little bit about how the language is structured and how, you know, the formalities and what this says about the relationships between people and the way they make people feel. \r\n And the language even if you don’t ever learn to speak it fluently, by studying its structure which you can do very easily, you can learn a lot about the people who have this as their native tongue. \r\n And you will be able to make them feel more comfortable in your presence and all of these things will help to facilitate the communication that leads to understanding and hopefully commerce if that’s your goal. \r\n (Donald Ellison): With the size of our country you almost need to have a cultural IQ opportunities to help us understand the regionality of our country and those working with us. \r\n Doug Barry: Yes, you do, and I think that’s one of the points that Dr. Livermore made. And this is worth emphasizing as we get to the end of our hour here, is that this framework, this takes into account all kinds of cultures, not just the ones that, you know, the sort of big culture differences but the cultures of organizations that we operate in every day, the cultures that are present in the different areas of the country where we live. \r\n This approach, seeing things differently and learning to understand others by understanding our own cultural attributes and the baggage that we have brought, you know, into our current life. \r\n These things can be extraordinarily helpful and don’t for a moment think that I’m not going to apply, you know, what I’m learning in this discussion today and that I’ve learned from Dr. Livermore and his book, even in the - and I made a joke about it earlier - about the, you know, the federal government, you know, having its own intercultural issues but it’s true. \r\n Just figuring out the culture of these large organizations and being able to deal effectively within them is a major challenge and one that I certainly more foremost in my mind then what I’m going to do with this Japanese friend in the next time I contact him. \r\n So yes, culture is everywhere in many different kinds of cultures. You know, think about what you have learned in these sessions. See if you can apply it and let’s keep the dialogue going. \r\n If you have questions or concerns or insights, you know, always feel free to pick up the phone and give us a call here or shoot us an e-mail. We’ll appreciate it and we’re here to help you. \r\n (Donald Ellison): Thank you. \r\n Doug Barry: Thank you very much. I think that that just about wraps-up this interesting afternoon for me and hopefully you’ve enjoyed it as well and that you will tune in for our next Webinar which is on the free trade agreements next week and I’m going to throw it back to Roza to wrap up. Roza? \r\n Roza Pace: Well, thank you, Doctor, for this very enlightening presentation. I think we all learned a lot from you and you gave us a lot of food for thought. It seems like having a wonderful product and having a contract at hand is very important but that does not necessarily mean the deal is clenched. \r\n Now remember for those of you whose questions we did not answer today or you were too shy to ask them, please feel free to call us.

Now, I will turn over the meeting to Ms. Margaret Gottlieb. You may begin. \r\n   \r\n MARGARET GOTTLIEB: Good morning, and welcome to the U.S. Commercial Service webinar titled, “Increasing Your Global Sales Using the Internet.” \r\n   \r\n This webinar is the fifth of a six-part series that focuses on export fundamentals. My name is Margaret Gottlieb and I’m an international trade specialist with the Commercial Service office in St. Louis, Missouri. This office is one of 100 domestic offices and 100-plus offices in over 80 countries. Our mission is to help U.S. companies by providing export counseling and assist with finding qualified agents and distributors overseas. \r\n   \r\n If you aren’t working with your local U.S. Commercial Service trade specialist, I invite you to set up a meeting with him or her to discuss your company’s goals overseas and how the organization may be able to assist you with your export endeavors. You can find us at www.export.gov. \r\n   \r\n I would like to express our appreciation to UPS for their corporate sponsorship of the Export Fundamentals webinar series. At this time, I would like to introduce Ashley Boggs, product manager, UPS Customer Technology Marketing. Ashley, please share your remarks. \r\n   \r\n ASHLEY BOGGS: Good morning, everybody. As Margaret said, my name is Ashley Boggs and I’m with United Parcel Service Customer Technology Marketing Group. And on behalf of UPS, I would like to welcome everyone to this webinar on increasing your global sales using the Internet. \r\n   \r\n One of the reasons UPS is excited to be a partner with the U.S. Commercial Service is our shared history of assisting customers to navigate international trade and assisting them in developing or enhancing programs that have increased our export business. And while we recognize the many complexities of international trade, we’re also keenly aware of the increased opportunities for business growth global markets offer. \r\n   \r\n Today’s webinar involves growing your global sales using the Internet. As many of you know, the Internet is the foreground of business and allows your business to compete with others around the world. This can provide enormous opportunities for your business, but it also increases the level of competition for your goods and services. \r\n   \r\n To give you some perspective on how UPS uses the Internet to grow our business, I’m going to share some facts with you about ups.com, our corporate website. UPS’ award-winning website launched in 1994. It is now available in 107 countries in 32 languages. There’s an average of 18.5 million page views on ups.com daily with 26.2 million on a peak day, normally around Christmas time. \r\n   \r\n There are 22.7 million tracking requests per business day with 35.6 million on a peak day. That’s a lot of use. UPS’s web channel continues to grow at double-digit rates and it’s no wonder considering some information about the habits of average shoppers today. \r\n   \r\n In the 2008 holiday season, Black Friday saw 534 million (dollars) in online retail spending. That was up just 1 percent from 2007, which is reduced from 2006. Eighty percent of our Internet users, almost 133 million people today will do some of their holiday shopping online. That’s up 50 percent from 2007. \r\n   \r\n And by 2012, the number of online buyers, people actually making a purchase on the Internet is going to increase by 30.3 million people, bringing the total to 141 million. That’s 73.5 percent of Internet users. And from 2007 to 2012, the number of new online buyers in the U.S. will grow at a 5 percent average annual rate. \r\n   \r\n It’s clear that consumers are moving to the Internet in droves, and it’s an important aspect for your business to compete. UPS has many tools available to assist all of your businesses. \r\n   \r\n And as a leader in global transportation and logistics, UPS is committed to providing our customers the most advanced solutions for their global shipping needs. For example, only UPS offers the cutting-edge industry first like our paper-less invoice that’s used for exporting without paper and our new delivery intercept service that ensures you always have access to your packages, even when they’re in transit. \r\n   \r\n Combined with our wide-reaching international returns and our new live chat to help you along the way, ups.com is making e-commerce easier than ever. And we do hope you find today’s information very valuable to your business. \r\n   \r\n We appreciate the opportunity to help you as you expand the global reach of your business. And we want you to feel free to browse and learn more about UPS in our business solutions area, which can be found on the Internet at ups.com. There you can view demos, make comparisons of different technology tools and even view the animated whiteboards. \r\n   \r\n If you have any questions about UPS services following the presentation today, please do not hesitate to contact your local UPS account manager. And if you do not currently have a UPS account or you need additional assistance, you can contact Cathy Bennett in the UPS marketing department, again, that’s Cathy Bennett, B-E-N-N-E-T-T, at cjbennett, which is C-J-B-E-N-N-E-T-T@ups.com. Or you can call this number and I’m going to give it to you twice, it’s (612) 378-3476. Again, that’s (612) 378-3476. \r\n   \r\n Again, thank you for participating today and I hope you enjoy the presentation. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you, Ashley, and now we’ll have a quick polling question. And while you’re answering the polling question, I’d like to apologize for the minor glitch that we’ve had in the twitching of the slide at the beginning of the presentation. And I would like to remind our presenters that if your cursor is anywhere near the changing of the slide arrows, they will change and everyone can see them. \r\n   \r\n During the conference, though, and having mentioned that, if anyone is experiencing technical difficulties – (gives queuing instructions). Also, at the top of your screen and slightly right, there’s a feedback box. Please feel free to let us know if you need help, are having difficulties hearing or would like the speakers to slow down. Looks like everyone has answered and thank you so much for that poll. \r\n   \r\n I’d like to now review the agenda. The purpose of today’s webinar is to provide an overview of international search engine strategies and how these can increase international traffic and potential customers to your site. Today’s webinar will be e-mailed to participants, along with a link to the recorded audio portion, which will be available for approximately 30 days. This information will go out to you no later than Monday, hopefully, by Friday. \r\n   \r\n I also wanted to mention that there’s a question-and-answer box. If you look toward the top of your screen, you will see a Q\u0026amp;A box. I’d like to encourage everyone to use the Q\u0026amp;A box at the top of your screen. We will answer questions at the end of the presentation. So don’t be shy on the comments and questions. This will increase the amount of information-sharing between everybody. Questions in the Q\u0026amp;A box will be anonymous. \r\n   \r\n And now, I’d like to begin today’s presentation with our first speaker, Mr. Cory Simek. Cory is the acting director of the U.S. Commercial Service office in St. Louis of the U.S. Department of Commerce. And he’ll begin for us today. Cory? \r\n   \r\n MR. CORY SIMEK: Thanks, Margaret, and thanks, Ashley and UPS as well. \r\n   \r\n We wanted to provide a brief overview of the Internet-marketing topic, again. Of course, when we have Joe – Joe Lieberman, not the senator, the other Joe Lieberman join us in a few moments. He’ll go into a good deal more detail on all of this. But we wanted to give you a little bit of an overview and some food for thought that will help you get a little bit more out of this presentation that follows as well. \r\n   \r\n You know, speaking of the Internet, it’s good to know how to – how to master the controls and move forward from slide to slide. Probably everybody is familiar with the four Ps of marketing: product, price, placement and promotion. \r\n   \r\n One thing we emphasize with our clients when we first start talking with new clients about international business is that all of the things that you know how to do when you market your product successfully right here in the United States, they generally still apply when you’re doing global business. You still have to think about your product, the price, how you’ll distribute or place your product and also how you’ll promote the product. \r\n   \r\n Also, with online and traditional international transactions, we find that there’s really no difference between online international transactions and regular, plain old paper or other international transactions. \r\n   \r\n You still have to think carefully about pricing your product; the same fundamental rules apply. You have to know how to determine your tariff rates, which, you know, probably everyone on this call is pretty familiar with and we’ve covered on other webinars. And if not, of course, we’re always here to help you. \r\n   \r\n Also, you have to think about shipping your product – what’s the best way to get it there? And, of course, you’ve got to know about your export licensing requirements and your local import requirements. All of the same things that you’re already concerned about to pull off good, successful international transactions. They still apply in the online marketing world. \r\n   \r\n Some questions to keep in mind as you listen to Joe’s presentation is what’s the purpose of your online marketing efforts? What’s the purpose of your web page? You want to promote or sell your product. \r\n   \r\n Now, at first blush, that might sound like the same thing. But if you want to sell products, you actually need the infrastructure built into your web page somehow to actually make the transactions happen, or perhaps you just want to use the web page to promote the product to let people know it’s out there, to talk about the features and the benefits and so on to build awareness. \r\n   \r\n Building brand awareness is a very common use of some web pages, and then you refer someone – you refer potential customers to other methods and other means of securing and closing the transaction. Or your web page might want to do all of these things or just perhaps provide customer support or relationship management, a way that customers can communicate with you in a more meaningful way. \r\n   \r\n You also want to consider other uses of your web page that might not be your primary use. For example, you might use your web page as a product promotion vehicle, but then also find that once you do have customers in a certain target market, that you can also use the same web page in a secondary manner for education or customer relationship management. Or data collection, for example, the way that we ask surveys on this web page. You can also use your web page for all of the above plus perhaps to gather some primary market intelligence. \r\n   \r\n You need to know who you’re talking to. Who is your target market? And you need to really think carefully about your target market. Are the people that you hope to attract to your web page, are they employees or customers? Some people might even be shocked at the suggestion of employees. But many successful web pages are geared primarily toward employees. And of course, your web page can be geared toward both. \r\n   \r\n But you need to think about who you want to communicate with via your web page, where are they when they’re using the web page? What are they thinking about when they decide to actually type your web page address into their browser? When do people turn to you and why? And that will help you make it a much more meaningful web experience for them. \r\n   \r\n Are you communicating with your agents or your distributors? You might have a whole different set of information available depending or perhaps your shareholders. And of course, your web base – communicate with all of these different stakeholders in different ways and I know Joe will go into a lot more detail about that. \r\n   \r\n You might have password-protected areas for your agents, for example, and entirely different public areas for websites for the product promotion and other outreach activity. So, overall, we need to think about what do each of the people that we hope to attract to our web page, what do they need from us? What are they thinking and doing? Where are they when they turn to us on the Internet? \r\n   \r\n And remember, we need to think about our objectives. We should always think about what we’re trying to accomplish and what we really want to do. That way the classic marketing – the classic marketing equation of building a better mousetrap and then the world beating a path to your door – Joe can tell us it’s really that easy just to build a better web page and then people coming knocking on your door. \r\n   \r\n But we have to think about, well, what is that mousetrap we’re building? What is the purpose of the web page? Do we want to grow our current markets? Do we want to sell more in the markets that we’re already in? Or do we want to attract new markets, new customers in brand-new foreign markets that we haven’t done business before? \r\n   \r\n And also we have to think of key markets in terms of their Internet use and their e-commerce use. For example, if you – if you develop a web page because you want to target the market in Timbuktu, but if there aren’t very many people online using the Internet in Timbuktu, that might not be a good combination then. \r\n   \r\n So in sum, as we prepare for Joe’s presentation in just a moment, we have to think about marketing in terms of what we want to accomplish, think in terms of our key markets, who are we targeting and where? And think about the extent of their Internet usage in those target markets? One example would be flash media for example. \r\n   \r\n We’ve all logged onto web pages and we’re assaulted with some audio, or perhaps there’s some really neat videos of the product. But perhaps our browser or our bandwidth isn’t high-tech enough to handle that kind of media. So we have to think in terms of who is using the Internet? How are they using the Internet? And are they able to use all the rich features that we’re used to? \r\n   \r\n And remember, the Commercial Service has plenty of reports on all sorts of markets. We have Internet reports. We can plug you into data on who is using the Internet in different countries and so on. We’re here for you online, just like we’re always here for you in person as well in your local areas. Right now, I’ll turn it back to Margaret so we can turn it over to our featured speaker for today. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you, Cory. Now, I’d like to introduce our featured speaker, Joe Lieberman, president and owner of SPIDERtel Inc. in Overland Park, Kansas. SPIDERtel is an award-winning firm that has been providing web redesign, Internet and marketing solutions since 1996. SPIDERtel helps transform businesses by identifying and achieving their objectives through the power of the Internet using proven marketing strategies, intuitive and functional programming and highly acclaimed custom graphics. \r\n   \r\n Joe has been recognized as an industry expert in the Kansas City area, is a former radio show host and an author of many published articles. He has also taught many self-written classes on Internet marketing. \r\n   \r\n I’d also like to mention that Mr. Alex Bach, vice president of Internet marketing of SPIDERtel will be available with Joe after the presentation for questions and answers. Joe, thank you for taking the time to share your experiment – experience and now, you may begin. \r\n   \r\n MR. JOE LIEBERMAN: Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about international search engine marketing strategies. SPIDERtel has been providing search marketing services, as well as web design services since 1996. That’s coming on 13 years and we’ve seen a lot of transformation as I’m sure many of the attendees on this webinar can understand. \r\n   \r\n Search engine marketing has changed about five times, 360 degrees throughout the decade. And each time, we learned that it comes down to the fundamentals of you how you build your website, not trying to follow short-term tactics that we think the search engines are looking for today. \r\n   \r\n And that’s one of the points I’d like to drive home, and that is that international search engine marketing is very similar to how you would go about marketing your website here domestically. The search engines primarily are looking for high-quality websites that offer good content to consumers, to your stakeholders. \r\n   \r\n And the key, as Cory mentioned in his short presentation, is really identifying and understanding who your audience is, what their interests are and insuring – excuse me – that your website is developed to meet those needs. There are many, many tactics and we’ll talk about several of them throughout the next half hour. \r\n   \r\n But I do want to stress that there are no silver bullets here; if there were, everybody would be doing it and it would be very simple to implement. But it is very much like running a business. You have to focus on the fundamentals and make sure that you’re providing extreme value to your prospective customer base. \r\n   \r\n If you have any questions after the presentation, myself and Alex Bach, our VP of Internet marketing, we’ll make ourselves available. The final slide will give – excuse me – some contact information. And at the bottom of each of the slides, there’s some additional contact information. And we’d be happy to talk to you about your particular need. \r\n   \r\n The opportunity here is vast, both domestically and internationally and it’s stated in the slide here. Seventy percent of all searches are not performed in English; that’s both for the United States domestic and the world. It really shows us that the West has transformed from being – originated here in the United States to something that is utilized worldwide. \r\n   \r\n Commerce is happening every day. We often get caught – questions from clients, more and more it’s rare, but they will ask us whether they’re target audience is using the Internet. And while it might have been an interesting question seven years ago, today, there’s no doubt, there’s no research needed, nothing is doubtful about it. \r\n   \r\n Your customer base is using the Internet. It crosses all demographics, all socio-economic boundaries. Obviously, the countries have to have access to the Internet provided, but people are trying on it more and more to conduct business, to do research, to find answers to their questions during whatever part of the purchase decision process they may be in. \r\n   \r\n We’re going to focus on five different areas. The first will be understanding the layout of search engines and how do you go about identifying who is popular? What search engines are being used in the particular countries that you might want to be targeting? This is obviously important because you want to be found in those particular search engines. \r\n   \r\n Some of this may not be surprising, but we’ll offer you some insight as to how to get additional information. Then we’ll start talking about what you need to think about in terms of hosting – excuse me – I have a cough I’m trying to get over here – about hosting your website, the location of your website and the domain name are very important considerations. Then we’ll talk about how to optimize your website. \r\n   \r\n There are two basic factors there, the on-site characteristics, those things that the search engines can read about you or your website. And the second part is how other websites are linking to you and what they say about you. Then we’ll move on briefly to paid advertising opportunities. They are similar to what we have here in the United States for text advertising throughout the search engines, also known as pay per click. \r\n   \r\n And finally, we’ll talk briefly about web analytics. And at this time, I think we’re going to move to the first poll. And the question here is, “Do you believe there is a significant demand for your products and services from international customers?” And we’ll let this run for a few seconds. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you for participating in this first poll. And can we show the results, please? Well, it looks, like, obviously, 92 percent of you believe, yes, that’s a good thing. And we’ll go on with Joe’s presentation. \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Okay. I think I’d be surprised to see different results; otherwise, we wouldn’t have attendees. (Chuckles.) \r\n   \r\n Okay. Talking – focusing on the search engines that we want to target. There are different languages. Obviously, depending on what country you’re in, trying to target, is going to indicate whether you need to have your website translated into other languages. And these will vary. There are some sources throughout the Internet that can fine-tune this. But what we have printed here is a list of languages in order from left to right in popularity, English being first, Chinese being second, Spanish, Japanese and so on. \r\n   \r\n It is also important to note that your website can be found in a non-English search engine depending on how the website is hosted and the location of that website. So it really depends on what the search is about, what your target audience is searching for. If they’re searching for English phrase keywords, then the search engine will try to deliver websites that have English as a base. And so it becomes a little difficult to anticipate whether you should have one language website or multiple-language websites. And we will talk about that in a minute. \r\n   \r\n Each country will have a popularity that will vary from one search engine to another, across the board, no surprises, Google is the champion of search engine usage throughout the world. They now represent about 70 percent of all searches. But it does vary from country to country. For example here when you go into Russia, there’s Yandex, which is a very popular search engine there. And I’ve listed a couple of others. \r\n   \r\n In China, this represents about – Baidu represents about 70 percent of the traffic for searches in that country. So it will vary. There are sources of information; some of it is free. And then other – other sources would be paid for. You can go to the two that are listed underneath the domestic search engines, searchenginecolossus.com and arnoldit.com to get additional information about how people are searching in various countries. \r\n   \r\n I will also mention that Yahoo is prevalent throughout the world; they just don’t have the market share that Google does. There’s a very comprehensive service by market share hits, which is paid, I’ve noted the URL there at the bottom. And if you are so inclined, you can go on there and search by country and get very detailed information about what each country’s search statistics are all about. \r\n   \r\n Perhaps the most important aspect of search engine marketing as I mentioned earlier, is understanding your target audience and how they’re going to search. Search marketers, of which we all are, oftentimes make the mistake that they understand how people will be looking for their products or services. We all understand our business intimately. We know the jargon. We know the industry terms. \r\n   \r\n But we often overlook that the people that are searching for our products and services or in the market for them – excuse me – may not know those terms and may be thinking about how they’re going to be using our products and services in a completely different context. They may not know that we exist. They may not know that our services are available. But they know that they have needs. \r\n   \r\n And so really, the most important thing you can do for yourself, whether it’s domestic marketing or international marketing is do research on how people are searching today as it’s centered around your products and services and not make any assumptions about how you think they might be searching. \r\n   \r\n Oftentimes, we will start with a list of phrases that we anticipate people will be searching on. There’s clearly some that are correct. But when we start doing the research, we will identify sometimes dozens and dozens of other phrase permutations that we were not aware of or not thinking of that people are actually using. \r\n   \r\n And so you need to go to the source. You need to rely on how people have historically searched on you, on your products and services. And I have listed a couple of really good resources for international keyword research and they’re noted here. \r\n   \r\n The first one is from Wordtracker. Wordtracker is a service that relies on aggregate information from users themselves and they’re accumulating this information, not from one particular search engine, but from people across many different demographics and how they search. \r\n   \r\n You enter in keywords that you think might be used by your target audience and it will return suggestions based on what you have entered. And this will lead you in many different directions, oftentimes, in tangents that you might not have anticipated, and really, that’s what you’re looking for, the things that you haven’t already considered. \r\n   \r\n Google also has a tool that can be used for a country-specific searching. Both sources will come up with different terms and they will also come up with different amounts of usage that they would predict that your audience will use over a monthly period of time. In Google, you’ll get two sources, one is they’ll come back with a suggestion of lists of words. That’s the second URL there. And the third URL will tell you what they would estimate would be the usage for those phrases that you are keying in. \r\n   \r\n Just a note of caution here that we’re really trying to get an indication of popularity of phrases and it should not be taken as literal the number or the count that you get back from either of these two tools. Our research – use of these tools over time tells us that they’re very good at predicting what phrases will be popular, but not so much in terms of with the accuracy of the count of those phrases. \r\n   \r\n So it’s important to get a relative perspective on what phrases are more popular than others and use some common judgment in terms of what you’re going to optimize for. And if it’s not obvious, the reason why you would – you would find those phrases and make some determination on what phrases you want to support is – you will then use that list to optimize your website, both on-site and how other websites are linking to you – excuse me – as well as to use those phrases in your keyword advertising if you choose to go with paid advertising. \r\n   \r\n The note at the bottom of this slide is very important, and that is to be careful with translations. As I’m sure you can appreciate, literal translation of phrases is not always useful when you go from one language to another. There are some good translation tools that are automated when you’re getting into large bodies of text. That’s when you will want to consider working with companies that do this for a living and really understand the nuances of the language. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you, Joe. I think now we have another polling. And that polling question is: Are you actively using search marketing for non-English international prospects? We’ll take a few seconds to have you answer. Okay. And here are the results. (Inaudible, background noise) – we’ll go to the – we’ll continue with Joe’s presentation. \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Well, that’s interesting. That says that a few of us are domestically marketing to other languages and most of the audience is not yet marketing internationally. Now, I’m going to focus on this area of when you do decide to try and market to particular countries. \r\n   \r\n How do you go about doing it? It’s not enough just to have a website and wish that you will get people from China to come to it. It’s not enough to translate your website into Chinese and hope that Baidu will pick it up or that people will be searching for it domestically or coming to google.com to trying to find your website. \r\n   \r\n We really have to be very deliberate about these decisions and it can be – it ends up being a very strategic decision. And it’s also a very critical one because it has long-term implications. There are two basic concepts here, the first is the TLD, which is your top-level domain, which is the last segment of your domain name, whether it’s .com or .uk or IE or whatever country’s extension it might be. The search engines will give highest relevancy to the extension, regardless of where it’s hosted. \r\n   \r\n And we’re going to talk about this a couple of different ways, and I’m going to move on to the next concept and then we’ll try and bring it altogether. The next concept is the IP address. Every website is on a server that has a unique IP associated with it. In fact, a server could have multiple IPs. \r\n   \r\n So your website will have a IP address. Some people may be familiar with them. There are four quadrants and there’s a range of numbers. It’s really not important for purposes of this discussion what numbers those are. But it’s like a phone number that points to your particular website. \r\n   \r\n And those IP addresses are allocated internationally. And so it’s very possible to know definitively where the website is hosted. And so you will know, for example, that a website is hosted in China or whether it’s hosted in the United States. \r\n   \r\n The search engines can give preferential treatment to IP addresses if they so choose, depending on where your website is hosted. And of course, your website can have a single IP address, although it’s possible to have it spread in many different locations across the world. And those are strategies that can be utilized with varying results. \r\n   \r\n So if you are targeting particular countries, we now have a couple of options at our disposal, in addition to the language. We have the option of hosting the website under the TLD associated with that country. And we also have the opportunity to have that website hosted in that particular country with that IP address. Some of these can be more costly decisions than others. \r\n   \r\n So it will depend on the importance, the significance of having – you target that particular country as to how you’re going to make your decision about where you’re going to host and what languages you’re going to feature. \r\n   \r\n There are, essentially, two main strategies. One is to have a single website and the other is to have multiple websites. If you have multiple websites, you now can host them in different locations with different TLDs and different IP addresses. We’ll talk about this is in a minute. But – excuse me – I do apologize for my cough. \r\n   \r\n We now have the opportunity to get inbound links from various websites that are targeted to that particular website. And I cannot stress how important that it is. I’m jumping forward a little bit. But when you get into search engine optimization, there are basically two different categories. \r\n   \r\n There’s how do you optimize the site and what the search engines read about it, the text essentially. And then there’s what other websites are saying about you. It is becoming more and more important to have good quality inbound links from other websites that’s being used as a measure of how authoritative and relevant you are for particular phrases. \r\n   \r\n So having websites located in different countries or with different TLDs makes those inbound links more relevant. You also can optimize for particular languages and particular phrases more easily if you are dealing with multiple websites versus single websites. Obviously, it’s much more expensive to do it this way. \r\n   \r\n Many companies choose to go with a single website and it is still possible to have success, although clearly you have to choose one location, have one TLD and one IP. Although this website could be replicated throughout the world, it becomes a little more complex because inbound links are still pointing to one domain name. \r\n   \r\n It’s possible to have a replicated website throughout the world on different IP addresses as well. This becomes a little more sophisticated. And for purposes of this discussion, we’re just going to focus on a single site in one location. But regarding inbound links, if you have inbound links from various countries, there’s still very, very important. \r\n   \r\n But the aggregate of them becomes a little more diluted because they would be across-the-board as opposed to from one particular country. And the search engines will in comparison to other websites that are singularly focused on a particular country or language, we’ll have something to compare it to. \r\n   \r\n Clearly, it’s harder to optimize for particular languages because you are more diluted across those languages. And it is – the advantage here is that it’s much less expensive to maintain one set of files, et cetera. I’m sure it’s easy to envision that. \r\n   \r\n To register domains with different TLDs, there are accredited registrars that are available to do that throughout the world. Some of them are domestic and each domestic registrar like Go Daddy or Network Solutions will have their own set of TLDs that they are authorized to register. But if you cannot find them available there, you can go to ican.org, which is the international agency to get assistance on identifying other registrars. \r\n   \r\n Now, we’ll talk about optimizing the site for your particular country. It’s critical that you don’t use automated tools to translate into that particular language because you’re sure to make mistakes. \r\n   \r\n I’m sure we’ve all seen that, where you see non-English providers of service translate their websites or text into English and it just looks really poor and unprofessional. And although you may understand it, you’re not giving the right impression. So it might get you part of the way there, but it certainly won’t get you all the way there. \r\n   \r\n Because this is a presentation on international search marketing, it’s not designed to give you all of the information associated with how you optimize the website for search marketing in general. That’s a five-hour class, and probably in over five different courses. So what I’m doing is just highlighting the things that you need to consider. We certainly recommend you work with a professional who understands how to optimize websites. \r\n   \r\n These are just highlights on what to consider. Title tags are the most important element of any search-engine marketing campaign. They should be treated very, very carefully. Description meta-tags, which appear on the header of websites, should also be treated carefully, although with Google and the top search engines, they don’t use them these days for determining whether you’re relevant. They use them to list in the search-engine listings. So they become a very important marketing tool. \r\n   \r\n There’s a keyword meta-tag that is very unimportant here in the United States but possibly very important to other search engines throughout the world. It really depends on which search engine you’re trying to focus on. \r\n   \r\n Potentially, though, as I stated earlier, you want to have good-quality content that focuses on the key phrases that you are targeting. There’s so many rules and tactics that people prognosticate on. Most of them are worthless, and you really need to be careful not to optimize – over-optimize, because search engines can tell that these days. It needs to read very well for the consumer. \r\n   \r\n Word-stuffing, massive repetition of phrases should not be approached. That can get you penalized and , at worst, banned. There is an opportunity to repeat key phrases, and it should be done, but it should be done in as natural a way as possible. \r\n   \r\n Clearly, we need to consider the culture and the lingo when you go through those conversions to that language. And ultimately, what you’re trying to do is drive consumers to make a decision about contacting you or, if you have commerce on the site, ultimately buying. There’s a good website called lisa.org (ph) which can give you some insight as to tactics that you should use for those particular countries. \r\n   \r\n Other design considerations – hopefully, this makes good sense to most people. You have to consider the culture. There are sensitivities to colors, and the lingo and the pricing and the payment process could vary from country to country. We’re not going to spend much time on that. \r\n   \r\n Search engines do try to determine whether your website is relevant for a particular phrase. And clearly, if you are focusing on a particular language, those phrases need to be prevalent. You might want to consider having dedicated pages focused on the phrases that you want to be found for. The more content the search engine can find related to those phrases, the better off you are. It’s not unusual for us to develop unique pages focused specifically on the phrases that we want to be found for. \r\n   \r\n You could also consider having phrases with the country, because some people may be searching for a particular phrase and add the country that they’re in because they want to know that you provide service for that. You will not be penalized for using duplicate content if your – if you have translated English to another language. That’s not considered duplicate content. \r\n   \r\n And for those of you that are wondering, if you have content that is duplicated in other websites, the search engines will not penalize the website that has the duplicate content, but they will make a decision about which website to use for that particular content. And this is the same if you have pages that have duplicate content within them. You won’t be penalized, but one page will become more prevalent than the other. So it becomes an important exercise to understand how you are driving people through your website. \r\n   \r\n Landing pages are very critical. You might want to consider having landing pages focused on keywords, plus the country that you want to be found for. It really depends on your research, how people have searched previously. \r\n   \r\n Google has the ability for you to submit local addresses if you are located in particular parts of the world. There’s a process to go through to submit your local address through Google and have it show up if people are searching on that particular locality, or they can identify what location they’re searching from. \r\n   \r\n And also, there is a tag that you can use that would appear in the header of your website to indicate what language you are having the page focus on. Then, this is information that the search engine will read, and they can give preference to that, to your pages, knowing that that’s what you’re focusing on. \r\n   \r\n Particularly domestically, there’s little use in trying to register your search engines. There may be search engines throughout the world where you have the opportunity to submit forms – submit your website to them, but more and more, the major websites find your website and crawl through it. \r\n   \r\n Google and Yahoo and MSN all have processes called site maps where you can create a list of your websites in XML and submit that to the search engines so they are able to find your website and crawl through it and see virtually every single page. This is essentially – extremely important, and you can also do this for your website internationally, at a minimum, to Google. \r\n   \r\n Having external links to your website will help facilitate the search engine’s finding you. That’s one purpose. And the other, as I stated before, is, it’s a vote in favor of how important your website is, for the authority of your website. \r\n   \r\n So if you’re doing business with vendors overseas, have any relationships with other companies or organizations, it’s important to seek out links from their website to yours, because it will help the search engine A, find you and B, cause you to be more relevant. \r\n   \r\n As I said, we can go on and on. This is just covering the basics. For paid placement, fortunately, it’s – the world is much smaller. You can get your ads distributed through all of the same major channels, plus one, as I’ve listed here, that we can do domestically – through Google, Yahoo and MSN. It’s fairly straightforward to run but requires a lot of sophistication in understanding your audience and budgeting and reducing your cost of click by having the highest-quality ads that are out there. \r\n   \r\n There’s really no difference between how you would market in English domestically versus how you would do it internationally. You’re just focused on different phrases, different terminology, different culture, et cetera. The tools are very similar, and China in particular, Baidu would be the one search engine that you would want to utilize. \r\n   \r\n I’m going to try and wrap this up so that we can leave some time for questions. There are – in terms of web analytics, there’s two different types. The first is based on the log files. The second is based on whether you’re running a script from your web pages that send referral information to the system that’s tracking. \r\n   \r\n The log-based files – very popular program called Webtrends ends reads those files and produces information statistically. The others will produce information in a similar format to you. We’ve noted a couple – Piwik (ph) which has a great tool. It’s free to use. And Google Analytics, which is also free, allows a very robust set of information. \r\n   \r\n The kinds of things that you can and should be looking at are how people have visited, how often, the countries, the geography, what page views. You are able to look through and find (pathing ?) information, how they have typically gone through your website, where they have exited, abandoned your pages, and how they are finding the website in the first place – what search engines are driving them there, what phrases they’re using to key in, to get to your website, and ultimately, how they are converting. \r\n   \r\n Some of these websites – or, search-engine tools require some customization and back-end work to get very detailed information about return on investments. But it is possible to track how somebody came to your website, what search engine, what phrase. If it’s an ad, how they clicked on that ad, ultimately, what it cost you and what it returned to you in terms of revenues and, ultimately, profit. All of this is possible today, and it’s a real marketer’s dream to be able to have all this information at your fingertips. \r\n   \r\n I am going to wrap this up, because I know the hour is fast approaching and I want to leave at least a few minutes for question and answer. So we’ll go to the last poll. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you, Joe. And the last polling question is, do you believe you can greatly increase your sales through improved international search marketing efforts? We’ll take a few seconds to answer the question. And looks like we’re going to show the results. \r\n   \r\n Looks like most of you are – say yes, and fewer are not sure. Thank you for that. And now I wanted to let you know that we’re going to go into the question and answers now. And just to remind, the Q\u0026amp;A box questions remain anonymous. Phone-in questions will be announced by the operator. Operator, please explain how questions and answers work through the operator system. \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Queuing instructions.) \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: And while we’re taking a moment for people to get into the queue to ask their question live, my colleague Chris Tolley (ph), in the St. Louis office, has been taking questions from the Q\u0026amp;A box. And we’ll open that up to her now. \r\n   \r\n CHRIS TOLLEY (PH): Thank you, Margaret. We did have a few questions. First one: “If one doesn’t have a specific market one is targeting other than Spanish, which is a given, into to what languages does one – (inaudible)? \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Could you please repeat that question? We had a little difficulty hearing you. \r\n   \r\n MS. TOLLEY (PH): Okay, I’m sorry. If one doesn’t have a specific market one is targeting other than Spanish, which is a given, into what languages does one translate their site? Was that better? \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Yes, that was. \r\n   \r\n MS. TOLLEY (PH): Okay, thanks. \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Okay, I think maybe the question is: What countries should we be focusing on? Because as I understood the question, it is given that we’re going to want to focus on Spanish. And there may be some variations on the theme here. But as I’m interpreting it, this would be where would we want to focus if we have an audience that is Spanish-speaking. \r\n   \r\n At a minimum, we clearly want to translate it into Spanish and then we have questions about whether we convert the site into one or more countries that would cater to the Spanish language. There would be many in Mexico, obviously. Overseas, there are a couple. And so in general, it’s impossible to answer that question specifically without knowing what the product and service is. \r\n   \r\n If the budget’s not there, then we either make the decision to focus on one or keep it more generic and focus on a .com, where we’ve translated the website into Spanish and hope that the search engines overseas will pick them up. But ultimately, if you want to be found in a particular country, we have to make a stand. We have to choose where we want to have our emphasis and that can be done by getting the TLDs and having the website hosted here domestically with that particular TLD, translate it, of course, into Spanish. \r\n   \r\n As I think about it, this might be one of the easier ones where you could have multiple TLDs for Spanish over the same website and each of those countries, then would see the same website. There wouldn’t be any penalization and you really would be optimizing for that particular language. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Okay, thank you. We do have a second question. “If one decides to maintain a single site and the company decides to translate that site in several languages and the site is a large one, should the company translate the whole site in each language or just the products and their features, the about us and contact information?” \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Well, it’s a good question. Again, it will depend on who your audience is, how sophisticated they are. It’s clear that English is a secondary language for many people across the world. So it may not be absolutely essential that the entire site is replicated. However, there are lots of models to look at. Depending on your industry, we may want to do some comparison, benchmarking. \r\n   \r\n For example, UPS, to see how they’re treating it. The larger organizations are going to have completely unique websites or rather sections of their websites that are stand-alone. But here’s the most important element and that is that the content on the website is rich enough that the search engines see you’re relevance for those phrases. \r\n   \r\n So it may not be enough just to have a product database that is stand-alone for those particular languages because if the site or the product displays may not have enough content within them that the search engines for those particular countries would see them as relevant. That’s another aspect that we would look at. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. At this time, Operator, do you show any questions in the queue? \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: Yes. Our first question comes from Joey Johnson (ph). Your line’s open. \r\n   \r\n Q: My name’s Kelly (ph) – is that who you’re talking to? Are you talking to me? \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: Yes. \r\n   \r\n Q: Okay. So my question is, if I’m not going to translate a website into another language, is there anything to be gained by putting metadata in, say, Spanish, onto the – into the HTML code so that the Google spider can see it? \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: So if I understand the question, would be benefit by having some meta tags that are – that are translated for that particular language, but the body of the site would not be translated? Is that correct? \r\n   \r\n Q: Correct. \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Okay, nominal. You can only have one title tag, for example. And that has the most weight of any tag that you can use throughout the search engine or rather, throughout the site. \r\n   \r\n So you’ve got to make a stand as to whether you’re going to translate that or not. The search engines are increasingly smart, particularly Google, about knowing whether there’s contents on the page that is of that language or not. So it might give you a little opportunity, but probably so insignificant that it wouldn’t help. \r\n   \r\n Q: Okay, thank you. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: We do have another written question. How do you find out if certain countries block some sites from their population? \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: We’re pausing. (Chuckles.) \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Okay. \r\n   \r\n ALEX BACH: This is Alex Bach. As a general case basis, most of the search engines out there are private, okay? And unfortunately, with them being private, they’re not very receptive to sharing a lot of their information. The U.S. search engines are much the same way. \r\n   \r\n They’re not going to tell you whether you’re banned or not with the exception of, now, Google, who has tried to assist webmasters in keeping their websites and their information within the Google index. Most other search engines are not going to provide you with that information. So it’s pretty difficult to tell whether you’ve been banned or not. \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: But Google, which represents the vast majority of traffic, does have a tool that you can go to. It’s not updated 100 percent of the time, but if you are banned, generally speaking, you will be able to identify whether you are or not. \r\n   \r\n And they’ve become increasingly more cooperative in helping you help yourself in getting unbanned from the search engine. If that’s what the question was regarding, you are not going to be able to find out what other websites are banned. I think that’s safe to say. But if it’s your own website, you would be able to find that out with Google. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Operator, do you have other questions from the queue at this time? \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: We have no other questions. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. We do have one more written question. “We want to put a price for our item on the site so that potential buyers have an idea of cost. However, pricing varies due to quantities purchased and type and country of buyer, the mode of shipping, et cetera. What kind of a phrase should we have on our website regarding pricing?” \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Well, it sounds like you will need – if you can’t deliver the price automatically, that’s something that you should consider. And it can be programmed to deliver that price based on the number of factors. \r\n   \r\n You could get very sophisticated and identify what countries are coming in and deliver it automatically or you could have the searcher, the customer, online answer what country they want pricing for. But very simply, statements around pricing will vary based on location and quantity and then the rest depends on what information you’re able to deliver online or whether they have to submit a request and then you follow up with you know, a quote. \r\n   \r\n We do have clients here domestically that have such statements. And when international clients are purchasing from them, they will need to wait for a quote because sometimes, international shipping of large items – it’s not practical to be able to get automatic shipping information. And it’s used. People overseas are accustomed to that. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. We do have an additional written question. “Is using the .com extension considered more global or international than using a national suffix? More and more non-U.S. sites seem to be doing this.” \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Well, the answer is yes. Non-U.S. sites are trying to market to the United States for obvious reasons and so it can apparently look like they are being hosted here in the United States. \r\n   \r\n That might be one of the factors that they are – they purchase the domain with a .com extension on it and they’re hosting it here in the United States even though it’s not .us, which would indicate that it’s in the United States. It is regarded as primarily a United States website. That being said, the international community does regard .com just as the rest of the world does, the United States, as being more familiar and more comfortable and more global. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. We have an additional question. “We currently use a vendor for hosting our website. Is there a way to use a secondary web analytics source to determine how effective our website is internationally?” \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Absolutely. If you refer back to the slide on web analytics, we mentioned a couple of sources for script-based statistics. We use Telex for example and it’s just a small piece of – I mean I think there’s two different areas that a small JavaScript that will send the referral information to wherever that statistics program is being hosted. And you can then monitor traffic, compare it to what the log files say and drill down into particular countries for usage there. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Operator, do you show any additional questions in the queue? \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: We do have one question. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Go ahead. \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: Our next question – your name was not recorded, so please state your name to ask your question. \r\n   \r\n Q: My name is – (inaudible, cross talk). \r\n   \r\n Q: Hi, this is – \r\n   \r\n Q: I wanted to ask – if I’m going to start a website in Canada, same exact duplicate of my current site, does it – will it be a good move to get Canada IP addresses so that Google search engine ranks me equal to the Canada-based sites? \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: Yeah. If the budget allows for it, your best optimal strategy is to have .ca – I’m going to wait for that noise to stop. Okay, your best – your optimal strategy is to have .ca as the website TLD and an IP address located in Canada. That’s two criteria that Google.ca will use to determine whether you’re hosted – whether you’re hosted in Canada or not. And you will have preference over similar website – similar content that would be in the United States with .com. \r\n   \r\n Q: Is there any way to get the Canadian IP address, yet still host your site where it currently is now? \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: I don’t think so. I can’t say with 100 percent certainty. I don’t believe you can do that. And so in other words, these IP addresses are not portable. \r\n   \r\n Q: So we would have the server farm in Canada in order to pull that off. \r\n   \r\n MR. LIEBERMAN: That’s correct. And I think, though, that there are things like proxy servers where there may be some host companies that can effectively manage it for you in the United States that will do that on your behalf. \r\n   \r\n Q: Okay, thank you. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Operator, do you show any additional questions in the queue? \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: We have no further questions. \r\n   \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. At this time, we don’t have any other additional questions in the Q\u0026amp;A box. We would like to thank everyone for participating in today’s webinar. And we also would like to thank our sponsors and presenters as well. We do look forward to you participating in our final webinar in the Export Fundamentals series. The last one will take place on March 18th and the topic is “Exporter Obligations/Export Control Update.” At this time, we can conclude our webinar. Thank you.

That is crucial. \r\n And you’re also going to learn some of the frequent misconceptions about NAFTA and doing business with or exporting into Canada. And absolutely become familiar with NAFTA record-keeping requirements. That is very, very crucial because NAFTA certificates can be audited so you want to be able to make certain that all of your documentation and all the proof that your products qualify are in your possession. \r\n And, you know, this is part of the Canada webinar series so we want to consider Canada first. And also think about webcam 2009 which is going to be coming up starting in September. And this is a one-on-one business meeting with potential business partners that you can do business with. And as you’ll see toward the end of my slide presentation, there is information on how to register and who you need to contact. \r\n So back to you Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, I’ve moved it to the next slide. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Thank you. \r\n So, you know, when you think about the Free Trade Agreements, and especially NAFTA and doing business in Canada, keep in mind that the objective is to promote trade between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico. The Free Trade Agreements -- and maybe it shouldn’t even say Free Trade Agreement because a lot of people think that means I can just box up my things and send them across the border. \r\n But there’s more to it than that. In addition to promoting trade, it’s giving greater market access to U.S. products and it also helps to promote fair competition when it comes to putting proposals together for contracts with governments in the NAFTA territories. And it also established the framework for further cooperation. \r\n Keep in mind if you get a handle on NAFTA, you’re going to have a much easier time understanding qualifying your products and using the benefits of all the other trade agreements. Go to the next slide, Linda. \r\n Now the immediate benefit and the one that seems to be the most important to our company is the fact that if your goods qualify and you provide the appropriate documentation, you’re not going to have to pay duties. Your customer isn’t going to have pay duties when they accept those goods into Canada. However, elimination of these duties is not automatic. \r\n So you may hear people talk about, you’ve got to qualify your goods. And there are certain steps that must be followed to carry this process out. The bottom line is the products that you are manufacturing or that you are trying to export to Canada; they must contain sufficient North American content to meet the requirements of NAFTA and the NAFTA Rules of Origin. If you’re product was manufactured in China, that is not NAFTA originating. \r\n Next slide. \r\n So in order to take advantage of NAFTA, you - it’s not that you have to be an expert, but I encourage companies to understand some of the elements of the Free Trade Agreement. You can go on export.gov and pull up the text of the agreement and just familiarize yourself with what it says, what it contains. \r\n You also want to ensure that products meet the Free Trade Agreement requirements. And if you are making a product here in the U.S. and it includes some foreign input, you’re going to have to go to the NAFTA Rules of Origin to make certain your good qualifies. And then complete the documentation, because without that document or without a certification statement on your commercial invoice, your Canadian importer won’t get the benefit of the Free Trade Agreement. \r\n So before I get into some of the other sides, some things that I just kind of wanted to put out there right up front were a few of the common misconceptions about NAFTA. And one is that U.S. Canadian and Mexican tariffs are the same. That is a misconception. It also is a misconception that tariffs are zero. Canada has its own tariff schedule. There MSN tariffs and there are NAFTA tariffs. \r\n So under MSN there may be tariffs. So to get the NAFTA percentage rate which is zero, you’re going to have to go through that qualifying process. Originating means purchased in a NAFTA country and I get that often with companies that I counsel. Originating means a little more than that, especially NAFTA originating. \r\n And once you go through the process to qualify your product, it is therefore deemed as NAFTA originating. So it has - it doesn’t mean if - it qualifies if you purchased it in a NAFTA country. Another misconception is that NAFTA certification is mandatory and that NAFTA certificates are required to clear Canada customs. That is a misconception. \r\n Going through the NAFTA process is totally voluntary. You don’t have to do it. It’s up to you. But if you do it, then it’s like selling your product to the - your Canadian customer at a discount. And the lack of a NAFTA Certificate of Origin does not prohibit your item from clearing Canada customs. \r\n A producer -- another misconception is that the producer has to give a supplier or a buyer a NAFTA Certificate of Origin. That is also a misconception. The producer can voluntarily go through the process, complete NAFTA Certificates and give to their customers, but there is no requirement that the producer do this. \r\n Another misconception that came up recently has to do with original NAFTA Certificates of Origin are on yellow paper. That is a misconception. I’m not sure where that came from, but that is not correct. Another thing that I just want to put out there is if you look up Canadian tariffs and under MSN there are zero duties, you don’t need to worry about NAFTA. You don’t have to qualify your goods because when it goes into Canada there are no tariffs that are going to be assessed on your product. \r\n Go to the next slide, Linda. And here’s a list of some of the - well, all of the free trade agreements that are in force as we speak. \r\n The next slide. \r\n So an important thing is qualifying your product. That is so important; it’s not all about, “Well, everything is made in the United States. I made my product in the United States.” That’s great, but that’s only half of the picture. \r\n The other half is going through the process of qualifying your goods. Now if you’re exporting a natural resource, then there’s probably not a whole lot you need to do. But if you have a product that you manufactured and you used some foreign input, you’ve got to go through the process and qualify your product. \r\n Go to the next slide. \r\n So in order to follow - get these steps taken, the first thing you need to do is get the appropriate Harmonized System number for your finished good as well as the appropriate HS code for any foreign input. That’s important. \r\n Then, the next step you could carry out is using the HS number for your finished product, go to the Canadian tariff schedule and check the duty rates. Under MSN it may be zero, it could be 2%, 3%; if it’s 10%, if you want to eliminate that duty for your Canadian importer, you have to go through the requirements and make certain that your product meets the requirements of the specific NAFTA Rule of Origins. And you’re going to find that Rule of Origins by using the HS code. The Rules of Origin are - they’re made out chronologically according to the HS code chapter. \r\n Could I have the next slide? \r\n So, you know, just to, you know, give you some information to help you understand the classification systems, the Harmonize System numbers or HS numbers are the general numbers for certain categories of goods that were created by the World Customs Organization. The Schedule B codes are numbers that were created by the U.S. Now the Schedule B includes the HS code plus four additional digits. \r\n And the Schedule B codes are normally used if you have to comply with the Automated Export System or AES. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States are codes that are used on goods when they are imported into the United States. But, again, the HTS codes start with the Harmonized System number -- the first six digits are harmonized around the world, and the United States added four more digits behind the six to come up with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. And those codes are used for importing goods into the U.S. \r\n Can I have the next slide? \r\n So one of the products that we’re going to look at, look at the classification number and, you know, and understand that, you know, how it was produced and the fact that they were foreign inputs, so of course we’re going to look at the Rule of Origin, but we’re going to use paint, and the Harmonized code is 3208.10 and it’s based on polyesters. And I believe the polyesters were imported. \r\n So what you want to understand is the first two digits represent the chapter, the first four digits represent the heading, and then the subheading are the first six digits, also known as the Harmonized System Number. And then you have the tariff item itself. So it’s important to understand about the chapter’s headings, subheadings, and even tariffs’ item because when you look at the Rule of Origin, it’s going to be saying certain things like “A change to subheading 3208.10 from any other chapter.” \r\n So I want you to understand what that all means and we will take a look at how to apply this within that Rule of Origin. \r\n Could I have the next slide? \r\n And another example we’re going to look at will be plastic bags, also made part of - some of the input was imported. And again, Chapter 39, heading 3923, subheading 392329 and then tariff item 39232990; so chapter, heading, subheading, tariff, item. Very important in the qualifying process. \r\n The next slide. \r\n So to get started with the product classification, the people that I counsel, I usually send them to the Census website to use the Schedule B search engine and they - you can use that to, you know, to determine appropriate classification numbers for both the finished good and any foreign input. Don’t be anxious in classifying your products by looking at the number associated with parts and accessories. \r\n You always want to do a search and find the most appropriate classification number for that item. And that’s the first general rule of interpretation. \r\n Everything you can think of has a classification number. So you want to use that number, not the number specifically - that specifically says “Parts and accessories.” Stay away from that number as much as you can. \r\n Could I have the next slide please? \r\n So we’re coming up to NAFTA Rules of Origin. And, again, because the three NAFTA countries do not have a harmonized custom regime, our tariffs are different. Rules of Origin have to come into play when you make a product and there’s foreign input. So using the Rule of Origin, those rules define how much foreign input is allowed. \r\n And then the Rules of Origin, just like the classification numbers are specific to certain products, the Rules of Origin are specific by product and are based on the Harmonized System. So if you have your HS code for your finished good, all you have to do is pull up the Rules of Origin, they go by chapter. And if your product falls in Chapter 32 or your classification number begins with 32, that’s your chapter; and you’re going to find the Chapter 32 within the Rules of Origin. \r\n The Rules of Origin, they may require what’s called a tariff shift. It may require that you figure out - mathematically figure out the regional value content and another way of looking at regional value content is North American content, so you’re actually being required to mathematically figure out the percentage of North American content in your products. \r\n Some of the Rules of Origin may require a tariff shift and North American content percentages. So the Rules of Origin are very, very important and you are, you know, you need to look at them and go by what that rule says. And of course if you have any questions or you need clarification, in the end you’re going to know who you can call and talk to about whatever NAFTA issue you may have. \r\n Could I have the next slide, Linda? \r\n So here’s the paint example. And the Harmonized number for paints is 3208.10. And it was manufactured in the United States and there was an imported acrylic acetate that was used in production. And the chapter that the acetate falls under is Chapter 39. \r\n So the specific NAFTA Rule of Origin requires a tariff shift. And that just means a change in classification number from whatever the number was for the acrylic acetate into the classification number of the finished good. In this case the paint. So the rule says, “A change to headings 3208 through 3210 from any heading outside that group.” So keep in mind the paint falls in within these headings, 3208 through 3210. \r\n The foreign input has to come from some other harmonized number heading that’s outside of that group. So in other words, if the acrylic acetate was 3206, that’s outside of that group. If it was 3212, that’s outside of that group. As it is, it actually falls in a different chapter altogether -- Chapter 39. So there’s been a change in classification number; the paints meet the requirements of the specific NAFTA Rule of Origin and therefore the paint is NAFTA originating. \r\n Could I have the next slide Linda? \r\n So the next example we’ve got the plastic bags and the harmonized number is 392329. The plastic bags were made from plastic pellets that were imported from Taiwan. And the classification number or the HS code is 3902.10. So keep in mind that’s the foreign input that we’re looking at. \r\n Now in addition, regional value content -- and I’m giving you the answers -- so the regional value content is 75% using either the transaction value equation or the net cost equation. So the rule of origin says and it requires for the rule as it’s written, the requirement is a tariff shift and reason of value content. \r\n So there’s a change to subheading 392329 which is the plastic bag from any other heading except subheading 392020 or 392071. So from any other heading is referring to the foreign plastic pellets from Taiwan. And the subheading for those pellets is 3902. So as you can see if you look at the Rule of Origin that is any other heading, 3902. That’s any other heading. It’s not 392329; it’s not the exception 392020 or 392071. \r\n Okay, so we are good with that. \r\n In addition regional value content or North American content must not be less than 60% using the transaction value equation or 50% if you’re using the net cost equation, okay? So what we’re telling you is that when we worked the regional value content equation and we used the transaction value and the net cost, the North American content is 75%. So therefore again the plastic bags qualify as NAFTA originating, even though there’s foreign input. \r\n So I want you to understand that even though foreign input may be used, it does not totally prohibit your item from being NAFTA originating. \r\n You have to use the Rule of Origin to make the determination your product qualifies as NAFTA originating because it’s got the foreign plastic pellets. Now the next slide Linda. And so as I was talking about the equation these are the equations for the transaction value and for the net cost. And you’re actually going to have to work those equations if regional value content is a requirement in the Rule of Origin for your product. \r\n Okay so can I have the next slide Linda? \r\n So here’s an example. The transaction value or TV minus the value of non-originating material, that’s the VNM divided by transaction value times 100. So this is how your equation is going to appear. \r\n You’re going to have 200 minus the 90 which is the value of the non-originating material and then you’re going to divide by 200 which is the transaction value. And that comes to 110 over 200 times 100. And what you’re getting is 55%. Now if that’s the product, it is not meeting that 60% minimum when you use the transaction value. So under transaction value the product is not qualifying. \r\n Can I have the next slide Linda? \r\n So we’re now going to use net cost; and again, the net cost minus the value of non originating material divided by the net cost times 100 to get that percentage. So we’ve got 182 minus 90 divided by182 times 100. So that works out to be 92 divided 182 times 100. And you get under the net cost equation 50.5%. It is meeting the 50% minimum under net cost therefore using the net cost equation the product qualifies as NAFTA originating. So 60% is the minimum if you use the transaction value, 50% is the minimum if you’re using the net cost equation. \r\n Some of the bigger difference in between transaction value and net cost, transaction value is the amount paid or payable for the item what you’re selling the item for. And the net cost amount will be what it cost to produce that item. There’s also additional information on export.gov that talks about items or expenses that are not included in the net cost. So the transaction value is going to be a higher amount than the net cost. \r\n Can I have the next slide Linda? \r\n Okay so we’ve got - we have paints and we have plastic bags and we have product X that met that 50% minimum under the net cost. So now it’s time to take a look at the preference criteria. And these are going to be letters and they are grouped into categories. And you really have to be careful as you take a look at the explanations for these letters. A lot of people jump to the conclusion that A is going to cover everything, but for the most part A probably would not cover manufactured goods because that is not a natural resource. \r\n So could I have the next slide Linda? \r\n And just, you know, just to, you know, give you some food for thought just keep in mind when you are looking at these letters, keep in mind first and foremost that when we are talking about NAFTA the product has to be produced in the United States, Canada or Mexico. It has to be. You cannot take components and send to Asia to be produced and put together there and bring it back to the US and expect it to be NAFTA originating. That doesn’t work. That item is going to lose the NAFTA benefits. \r\n So wherever you see the good has to be wholly obtained or produced in a NAFTA country, that is exactly what it means; it has to be done here in the US. So if you are growing and harvesting and fishing things or mining things within one of the NAFTA countries, that’s NAFTA originating and you’re going to use A as the preference criterion. \r\n If you are going to -- if you’ve manufactured goods like the paint and the plastic bags and both of those contained foreign parts or components or raw materials but as you notice in the slide it met the requirements of its specific NAFTA Rule of Origin that’s going to be B as in boy. \r\n When you talk about C, C is a product that was manufactured using NAFTA originating parts and components. The same way a totally finished good can be qualified, parts and components that are manufactured in the US can also be qualified. You go through the same process. So if you make a good and you have used exclusively NAFTA originating parts or components and you have information to support your claim, you have proof, that product qualifies automatically. And you’re going to use C. \r\n So you can’t have a foreign something that you put into production with the NAFTA originating parts or components because if that happens, that’s going to go back to being B as in boy. But if that good is manufactured exclusively with NAFTA originating parts or components it qualifies automatically and you are going to use C. \r\n The preference criterion D covers goods where the HS code for the products and its parts is the same. So in this case, a manufacturer is allowed to use regional value content to see whether the good originates. \r\n That - you know, I’ve had many callers who, you know, think they understand what that - what D means and they go ahead and they use D, but once we go over the process and we’re looking at the components and we find out that the components have their own classification number, different from the finished good, then it’s not going to be D. \r\n So D is - D happens what I consider rare instances. \r\n E; E applies to HS code specific, automatic data processing equipment, whereby these HS code specific pieces of equipment, the three countries agreed the actually harmonize the duty amount on these goods. \r\n And even though some of these goods may come from some other place in the world, if they are imported into a NAFTA country, they could then be exported to another NAFTA country getting the benefit of NAFTA. And if that’s the case, you would use preference criterion E. \r\n And F applies to certain agricultural products and one thing that comes to mind it had to do with fur skins. The - that’s only if the fur skin is being exported to Mexico. The agricultural sections were negotiated on a bilateral basis, rather than a trilateral basis. \r\n Linda, can I have the next slide? \r\n So you’ve got paints and you’ve got plastic bags and there is Product X. And so now you know that these three things qualify under NAFTA and we pretty much know the preference criteria for each one. \r\n So then you want to go to the NAFTA Certificate of Origin. You want to pull that up and start putting that together. \r\n Can I have the next slide, Linda? \r\n And I just want to point out that with the NAFTA Certificates of Origin, if you are using the ones that say Department of Homeland Security, you are using the most current NAFTA Certificate of Origin. \r\n If your NAFTA Certificate of Origin has an expiration date in the upper right-hand corner, just ignore that. That expiration date is between U.S. Customs and OMB. So it doesn’t mean that your NAFTA Certificate has now expired. So don’t worry about that. \r\n There are instructions that most of you have probably seen and my personal opinion is that the instructions are an attempt to explain the different fields or what is to go in the different fields. So you can look at the instructions and determine, oh yeah, my product meets (Set) B, so I’m going to use that and fill out a NAFTA form. \r\n And then come to find out that product was manufactured in Turkey. Well, it’s not going to do you any good because Turkey is not part of NAFTA, so you cannot do a NAFTA Certificate. \r\n So let’s just take a look at the different fields. Field 1 is sort of explanatory but not because a lot of people have problem with that. Some people have a problem, you know, indicating themselves as exporter, but if you are exporting the item, if you are selling that item to someone in Canada, you for the purposes of NAFTA are the exporter and your information should be placed in Field 1. \r\n For all of the fields where Tax ID is mentioned, Tax IDs are required. You cannot complete a NAFTA certificate without providing the Tax ID number. The only field that can be left blank is Field 2. \r\n The only time - actually the only time a Field 2 should be completed is if you are selling your NAFTA originating product on a regular basis; monthly, weekly, biweekly basis to your customer in Canada, you can then put dates in there and the dates can be up to a year, which makes your NAFTA Certificate that you send to you Canadian importer valid for up to a year. \r\n So every time you make a shipment to them, they have this one NAFTA Certificate of Origin that will cover that shipment. So you don’t have to worry about completing a NAFTA certificate every single time you ship. Make this one a blanket certificate, send the original to your customer and they are set for the year, unless, of course, something changes about your product. \r\n In Field 3, the manufacturer name and Tax ID is going to be in that field. And in Field 4, the Canadian importer’s information and Tax ID number will be presented. \r\n Now, if the exporter is just the exporter/seller of the item, and the exporter has obtained the goods from a manufacturer in the U.S. and the exporter/seller does not want the Canadian importer to know who the producer is, the exporter seller in Field 3 can put available to customs upon request. \r\n So you don’t have to divulge who the manufacturer is. But if Canada Customs asks you, you have to provide that information to Canada Customs. \r\n The other thing is if you are selling and exporting to multiple companies in Canada, in Field 4 you can say various. That is, it’s acceptable to say various. \r\n And then we come to Description of Goods, and really that’s all is asked for; description of goods. So I can put in here paint, based on acrylic acetate or whatever else. But that’s all I need to put in there. \r\n And then my next item, plastic bags. So I’m going to indicate the classification numbers, the HS codes in Field 6 for each of those NAFTA originating items. \r\n In Field 7 I’m going to use B because these goods were made in the U.S., they contain foreign ingredients, foreign material but they met the rule of origin, so that’s going to be B as in boy. \r\n If I’m the producer, I’m going to say yes in Field 8. If I buy from a manufacturer, I’m going to ask the manufacturer if the goods qualify and if they do, I’m going to ask for a NAFTA Certificate, and in Field 8, I’m going to say no, I’m not the producer and I’m going to follow that up with a 3 which tells the customs people I know the goods qualify because I have a NAFTA certificate from the manufacturer. \r\n There are other number, No 1, No 2, but No 1 requires that you have - if you’re not the manufacturer, you somehow have to have personal intimate knowledge that these products qualify. \r\n And if you are not in the manufacturing plant, then you wouldn’t really have personal intimate knowledge that it qualifies, so I - NAFTA, you know on the NAFTA form, No 3 is in my opinion the best response to place in Field 8, even if you say No 2. That means you have some other written representation from the producer. \r\n For me, the producer if they give me something else other than a NAFTA Certificate, I want it to include the harmonized number of that good, I want them to give me the preference criterion and I want them to tell me if they had to use the net cost equation to qualify their product. I want all that information in that other document. \r\n You know, any other document other than a NAFTA Certificate. I want the same information that would be contained in a NAFTA Certificate. \r\n And then in Field 10 - well, getting to Field 9, if net cost is what we use to qualify the product, we’re going to say put in C for net cost. No, you don’t put any money amount. No money amounts on the NAFTA Certificate. \r\n In Field 9 it’s either going to be NC or No. So if I didn’t use the net cost equation, I used the transaction value equation, I’m going to say No in Field 9. If my rule of origin did not require region of value content, I’m going to say No in Field 9. \r\n And in Field 10, Country of Origin put U.S. for United States or CA for Canada. \r\n Now, most importantly is the certification and it’s really important that whoever is completing this document, whoever is going to sign it read the certification because that also tells you everything that you need to know about completing this form. \r\n And a lot of people just fill out the form and send it on and there’s no supporting information or documentation. That can be a problem, so read the documentation before signing and putting your title and the dates and providing this NAFTA Certificate of Origin to your Canadian importer. \r\n And another thing that comes up every once in a while, some of my callers want to make their commercial invoice and the NAFTA Certificate of Origin the same. \r\n While these are two different documents, one document you’re going to always use and you’re going to always provide that, but NAFTA Certificates of Origin, those are voluntary documents; this is a voluntary exercise so you’re not - you don’t always - you may not always do a NAFTA Certificate of Origin. \r\n So - and as you can see, most of the information is different from what you would find on a commercial invoice. \r\n Under Field 5, I have people putting quantities. I have them putting part numbers and I have them putting SKU numbers. All you need to put is just say what the item is; it’s paint or it’s plastic bags or it’s motor oil. That’s all you need to put in there and then the appropriate HS code. \r\n So NAFTA Certificates of Origin and commercial invoices, they weren’t meant to match, so they do not match. \r\n Can I have the next slide? \r\n The NAFTA Certificate of Origin is completed by the exporting or selling company. \r\n What you want to look at is the transaction - if the transaction is between the seller in the U.S. and the buyer in Canada, and the seller in the U.S. wants to provide a NAFTA Certificate, okay, then, you’re the exporter. \r\n Even if you send your item to someone else and then they take it across into Canada, for the purposes of NAFTA, you’re the exporter. Or if the manufacturer or someone else puts everything together, you know, the product and what have you, and they drop ship it, that commercial transaction is between you and the person in Canada. \r\n So if you’re going to give them a NAFTA Certificate, then your information is going to be in Field 1. \r\n And I always recommend sending the original to the customer. And if you want to run two originals, send one to your customer and keep one in your files along with other records. \r\n Can I have the next slide Linda? \r\n Record keeping is another very, very important element. And importers and exporters should maintain their documents for up to seven years after the goods go into Canada. \r\n And the documents that you want to hold on to relate to the purchase, the cost, the value and payment for all materials, direct or indirect that were used in production. \r\n Customs officials can seek information from either party. \r\n Can I have the next slide? \r\n One of the things that came to my attention some time ago are Bill of Materials. \r\n A lot of people that I talk to don’t quite understand what I’m talking about and they don’t quite understand information that’s going to be important to them in qualifying their good and in answering any questions that may come from the customs authorities in Canada. \r\n So a Bill of Materials chart is a widely used and accepted method of documenting the origin determination. And, you know, just a regular Bill of Material chart can, you know, list the product; what it is. So in other words, I could list paints and under that I’m going to indicate components that go into making my paint. \r\n I’m also going to provide where it came from; the supply stores. Now keep in mind, this information is for my NAFTA technical file. It isn’t something that I’m going to share with the public. Only, only am I going to show that to Canada Customs because they’re the ones who may ask for it. They’re the only ones I have to show this to. \r\n So on this Bill of Material, you want to supply source and of course I want the origin of any foreign input, so like with the paint, I have a foreign input. So I’m going to indicate that it came from Turkey or Pakistan. \r\n I’m also going to have HS code for the paint, I’m going to have a HS code for the foreign inputs and the values on things, because you never know if your rule of origin requires looking at regional value content or North American content. \r\n What is the percentage of North American content? \r\n So a Bill of Materials chart I think is an excellent, excellent tool to use in documenting the origin. \r\n Can I have the next slide? \r\n And, you know, just so that you know that, okay, NAFTA does work, I’ve put some very, you know, quick information about a company or a couple of companies in Illinois; one who exported for the first time. \r\n They found the commercial service and they got all the necessary international trade information and NAFTA assistance, actually both of them did, as well as they got information and they were walked through that qualifying process so that they could make the determination that their products qualified. \r\n And they were able to do that and to fill out the paperwork completely and factually allowing to successfully get their products in to Canada. And one of them, after they got the assistance they needed, they were able to export their product into Canada on the same day. \r\n So I called those some really great NAFTA successes. \r\n Can I have the next? \r\n And then one last thing talks again about Canada First and (left hand) 2009, you know the necessary information is there to answer some of your questions. \r\n On the next slide, Linda, there is information on, you know, registering and who it is you need to contact and there you have, (Madelyn Lopez), who is the project Manager. So if you have additional information about that, please call (Madelyn). \r\n Linda? \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, great. \r\n JoAnn Queen: And here’s my information. Questions? \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, great. Thank you JoAnn for your presentation... \r\n JoAnn Queen: You’re welcome Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: It was very well said. \r\n Thank and now we’ll go to our written questions from our audience and just remember - just to remind everyone, if you would like to ask a written question, up on the top of your screen there’s an icon with a Q and A letters, and all you need to do is just click on that icon and start typing in your question and we will answer them. \r\n The first question is from (Farzani Arian). \r\n The question is for JoAnn is can you please give an example for a Category E? \r\n JoAnn Queen: Category E, let’s see, they were - well, automatic data processing machine, that’s just a fancy word for a computer, computer hardware. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, great. Thank you. The next question here is from (Elizabeth Gant). JoAnn, she wants to know where do you find the list of automatic data processing products if you’re under the Criteria E. \r\n JoAnn Queen: You won’t. I mean, you may, but here’s the thing; this was specially negotiated. The three countries agreed to harmonize the tariffs on these products. Two countries ratified the agreement and the last I heard, the other one had not, and this was quite some time ago. \r\n There’s really no need to use E because these items going into Canada definitely are duty free. So you shouldn’t be using E. There’s no need to use E. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: And email me and we can talk about that more. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, great. Thank you. We will open the lines now for written - excuse me, voice questions since there are no more written questions. \r\n Coordinator: Once again, to ask a question, please press star then 1. We have a question from (Debbie Durr). Your line is open. \r\n (Debbie Durr): Hi JoAnn. Great job on setting this. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Hi (Debbie). \r\n (Debbie Durr): Hi. Thank you so much. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Thank you. \r\n (Debbie Durr): Really great information. \r\n My question is when calculating regional value content, many times I’ve seen the example where you have one foreign component or material. What if you have a product that may have 30% of one HS number, 30% of another, 30% of another; they’re mixed, you know, all mixed up, different HS numbers? \r\n How would you then go about calculating - say, two of those might be foreign content; 30%, 30% or something like that, I’m just wondering, get very confused when there is more than one HS number... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Well, okay, do you mean in the part of the Rule of Origin where it talks about a tariff shift or do you mean when you actually go to the equations? \r\n (Debbie Durr): When you see there’s a tariff shift and you may have several HS numbers... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Right. \r\n (Debbie Durr): …that that end product is made from. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Right. So - okay, my example was the plastic bags, so every - any foreign component has to make that shift. So I had the plastic (unintelligible) was 3902, so it made the shift. If I had something that was 2819, another foreign item, it made the shift. \r\n (Debbie Durr): Oh, okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: If I have something that was 3712, well, it made the shift. The exceptions were 3920.20 and 3920.71, so that’s where you’d have to, you know, watch out... \r\n (Debbie Durr): Okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: But every foreign input, that’s why it is important to have the appropriate HS codes for the finished goods and the foreign input; all of them because they’ve got to make that shift. \r\n (Debbie Durr): Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: We do have a question from (Nuresh). Your line is open. \r\n (Nuresh): My question is very similar to the question that was just asked, so if you’re manufacturing a good that has, say, 10 inputs, they’re using the manufacturing process, one of those inputs, for instance, needs to meet like an RVC threshold of 60, however it only has an RVC content of 10, does that mean that that good no longer qualifies? \r\n JoAnn Queen: You know, if you work - let’s say you work both equations, the transaction value and the net cost and let’s say on both of them your answer was 10%, you do not have a NAFTA originating product. \r\n (Nuresh): Okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: No, it doesn’t - it’s not qualifying. The minimum is 60 under transaction value; the minimum is 50% under the net cost equation... \r\n (Nuresh): Right. \r\n JoAnn Queen: So that - those are your thresholds that you have to meet. Those are the minimums. \r\n (Nuresh): Okay, well, so then because let’s say, for instance, you have five different inputs so there’s like five tariff shifts, right? So like there’s a tariff shift, you have five different inputs, so let’s say Input Number 5 only comprises 10% of the final good, but it does not meet that threshold, does that mean the entire good does not meet the origin even though... \r\n JoAnn Queen: But - okay, the rule of origin - well, are we talking about a rule of origin with a tariff shift or are we talking about a rule of origin with just regional value content, are we talking about tariff shift and regional value content? What are we talking about? \r\n (Nuresh): Tariff shift and regional... \r\n JoAnn Queen: And what does your rule of origin say? \r\n (Nuresh): My... \r\n JoAnn Queen: It’s always better to work with your rule of origin. \r\n (Nuresh): Okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: What does your rule of origin say? \r\n (Nuresh): Well, this is just more of a hypothetical, so I’m saying... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Okay. Email me. \r\n (Nuresh): Okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Email me or call me after this is done and we will - we’ll talk till the cows come home. \r\n (Nuresh): Okay, great. Look forward to it. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Okay. \r\n Coordinator: Once again, to ask a question, please press star then 1. We have a question from (Jose). Your line is open. \r\n (Beth Billingsly): Actually this is (Beth Billingsly) with (Avred Express). \r\n JoAnn Queen: Hi (Beth). \r\n (Beth Billingsly): Hi. We’re a transportation provider in the Southeast and we get a lot of questions from our customers in regards to NAFTA. We really - we don’t really feel comfortable in trying to advise our customers. \r\n The number you’ve got which is on the screen, is that the number that we should advice our customers to call? \r\n JoAnn Queen: You got it. \r\n (Beth Billingsly): Okay. That was my question. Thank you. \r\n JoAnn Queen: You’re welcome. \r\n Coordinator: You have a question from (Nuresh). Your line is open. (Nuresh), your line is open if you wish to ask a question. \r\n (Nuresh): Oh, no, we already just asked that question. \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay. \r\n Coordinator: Once again, to ask a question, press star then 1. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, this is Linda. I’ll ask a couple more written questions that we have and then we’ll go one more time back to the verbal questions. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Okay. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: The next question I have here is from (Greg Pilgrim). The question is what are - how are textiles treated differently being that they are now allowed to use the RVC formula. It appears to be based on weight. \r\n JoAnn Queen: (Greg)... \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Hello? \r\n JoAnn Queen: Is he there? \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Oh, no, I don’t know, but... \r\n Coordinator: I can open his line. \r\n JoAnn Queen: That’s okay because I have (Greg)’s - I have his information so I can get in touch with him. \r\n Coordinator: (Greg)’s line is open if he wishes to speak. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Hello, I’m here. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Oh, (Greg). \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Hi JoAnn. \r\n JoAnn Queen: How are you? \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Good, thank you. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Good. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): You know, the question we’ve talked about it in the past and I’m still struggling with it is we’re not allowed as a textiles manufacturer in the states to use the RVC formulas. We have to go by percentage weight of content. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Right. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): And I don’t know why it’s treated that way. I don’t know if it’s specific in the trade agreement itself. It’s much more limiting in my opinion, but... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Right, well, (Greg), let me give you a number for (Martin Walsh). \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): That was going to be my next question, who... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Explore that with them. He’s in the Office of Textiles and Apparel and his number of 202-482-3400. And even if you get voicemail, please leave your name, number, the date and time that you call, and either he or someone in that office, I know they’ll call you back. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): And it’s the Office of Textiles... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Textiles and Apparel. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Okay. And I guess the second part of that question and (Martin) may be the answer to it is, what is the best resource for individual companies in their locale for face-to-face NAFTA questions? \r\n JoAnn Queen: Well, you know, I think you could try the U.S. Exporter Systems Center in your area. I would start with them, because, you know, plenty of my colleagues in the field are familiar with NAFTA stuff, as well. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Our local one doesn’t seem to have an expert on it any more. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Oh... \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): That’s why... \r\n JoAnn Queen: Okay, okay. Let’s talk about that and I’ll try and get you someone else. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Okay. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Okay. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Thank you. \r\n JoAnn Queen: You’re welcome. I’m glad you made it. \r\n (Greg Pilgrim): Me, too. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, thank you, JoAnn, and this is our last written question for today. This is from (Carrie Hester). It’s a comment. It’s about when several foreign inputs are used in the production of an end item and a regional value content calculation is required, does this mean the (VNM) means the total aggregate value all non-originating materials. \r\n JoAnn Queen: Yes, yes. It’s a total of all the non-originating material. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, great. Thank you. And one last time for voice questions. \r\n Coordinator: At this time I’m showing no questions. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you everybody for your time. And once again, thank you JoAnn for your excellent presentation. \r\n JoAnn Queen: You’re welcome Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: I just would like to let everyone know to check out export.gov - www.export.gov for more upcoming events and webinars. \r\n We will also archive this webinar under the Canada webinar Series, along with all the other webinars for that series of export.gov website under the View webinars link.

And in particular, to think about how it connects with some of the international opportunities that exist for US businesses. \r\n Most anyone I talk to these days is pretty excited about the national export initiative and the opportunities this can create for US businesses around the world, and I don’t imagine that you need me to review all those for you. But, just a couple points to get started as a way of framing how cultural intelligence relates to this. \r\n Some recent studies found that last year 70 million joined the middle class in developing nations around the world. And as you well know, many of these are individuals who were working in service centers outsourced to India, or manufacturing plants outsourced to China. And what I find interesting is we can either sit back and bemoan all the job losses that have resulted from this reality, or we can do as many American businesses are doing and tap the purchasing power and opportunity that exists among this growing middle class internationally. \r\n In fact, we’re told that conservatively 1 billion people are expected to join the middle class in the next decade, which perhaps helps explain why GE is predicting 60% of its growth in the coming decade will come from the developing world, even though only 20% of their growth came from the developing world over the last decade. \r\n But, global business is not just where you do business, it’s about how you do business and that’s what I really want to talk to you about today. How do you expand into international markets with cultural intelligence, which is an evidence based approach to international business. And let me first say what this is not. It’s not just another way to talk about cultural sensitivity and global awareness. Surely we know that those are important emphases for any of us in business, even if we never leave our own borders. \r\n But quite honestly, I’m not sure that most of the business people I interact really need one more lecture on not being ugly Americans and on the need to be flexible, even through certainly, those re ongoing important realities for us. The question that I am interested in exploring with you today is one that’s really driven our work on cultural intelligence, and it’s this one. What’s the difference between individuals and businesses that succeed in today’s globalized multicultural world and those that fail? \r\n I would imagine as soon as I ask that question, you immediately think of some of your own experiences of things you've seen personally or in the lives of colleagues or partners that have done well or not done well. And so the question is perhaps this. \r\n Why is it that some entrepreneurs sell their product in 15 different countries and others can’t seem to move their product beyond the land of red, white, and blue? Or, why do you have companies like Coke that have successfully sold more products in Japan, a tea loving population with one-third of the population of the US? And, there’s other companies that still think their best markets are just those that lie within our own borders. \r\n And, why is it that you have some individuals in your business that seem to be able to navigate the many varied interpersonal, legal, and economic differences from one culture to the next, and others seem to be oblivious. And in many regards, this is often - seem to be just kind of an intuitive skill set that people have, and to some degree I would agree with that, and perhaps we can interact about some of that in the Q\u0026amp;A time. Because there are all kinds of things that contribute to one’s success or failure in international ventures. \r\n But, through our research over the last ten years across 30 different countries around the world, there is a group of us who have found that an individual and company’s ability to be successful in a variety of cultural context can largely be pinned upon this one primary factor that we call cultural intelligence, or your cultural intelligence quotient. \r\n And so in the few minutes that we have together on today’s Webinar, there’s three things that I want to cover. What is cultural intelligence and why does it matter? Secondly, how is cultural intelligence measured? That is to say, can you really take something so subjective and make it a more concrete empirical measurement? And then thirdly, what is the relevance of this material to international trade and exporting? \r\n So, let me being with this first one, by seeking to explain what is CQ and why does it matter? First of all a definition. Cultural intelligence quotient can simply be defined as the capability to function effectively across various cultural context, and we’ve researched and applied that as broad to different national cultures, ethnic cultures, but we also look at it in terms of various organizational or professional cultures, or even generational cultures or sexual orientations, religious ideologies. \r\n And so much of our work certainly applies to diversity initiatives in the workplace. But given the nature of our conversation today in doing this together with the Department of Commerce, my interest is in specifically talking about cultural intelligence as it relates to one nation versus another and how we do business there. \r\n And you see the bullet underneath that definition saying that it’s one of the multiple intelligences. So, our choice of the term intelligence is more than just a cutesy way of describing cultural competence. Our work is actually related to some of the other work that would be familiar to you in the intelligence research. So for many years those of us in business have been hearing lots about the idea of emotional intelligence. \r\n And sometimes, I feel like the emotional intelligence research simply put data around something that many of us had been experiencing in the workplace for a number of years. That is to say many of us in the workplace were saying to universities, like the ones of which I’m part, “Hey, quit sending us MBAs with 4.0 GPAs telling us that they’re ready for business, and yet we end up finding out that they fail miserably because they can’t interact effectively with our colleagues or with prospective clients. \r\n And so, we heard much about emotional intelligence and with good reason. The importance of having one who’s self aware and others aware, particularly as it relates to their emotional capabilities. What cultural intelligence does is pick up right where that leaves off. Because, a great deal of performing with emotional intelligence requires that you can pick up on social cues that are going on in a cross-cultural interaction. \r\n And, it may well be that what silence means in one conversation in a familiar cultural context, that is perhaps confusion or boredom, or something like that, in another cultural context silence might actually mean that they’re being very respectful and that they’re trying to demonstrate honor for what’s being communicated. And so what cultural intelligence does is say how do you use some of those same soft skills in a different cultural environment that you just intuitively use in your own same cultural environment? So, that’s what we mean by cultural intelligence quotient. \r\n One other thing to say by way of definition is as I’ve already mentioned, and CQ applies to any cultural context. And so what I find - part of what stops small and mid-sized businesses from jumping into international ventures is just the sheer overwhelming thought of learning about all the trade policies and legal parameters to ensure you don’t put yourself at risk. \r\n And then add to that the challenge of learning different cultures and how to effectively do market research, and promotion, and production, and distribution, and sticking to what’s tried and true versus connecting with the local context. And then you add to that language barriers, religious barriers, corruption, transparency; it’s easy to be overwhelmed by just the sheer enormity of differences that exist in all the different cultures available to us. \r\n And I certainly don’t want to sugar coat this, but some of the very real realities and issues that we found in the way that businesses and individuals effectively deal with this can be largely pinned upon this more macro overall capability of cultural intelligence. \r\n What I mean to say is for sure if you’re going to start doing a lot of business in China or Brazil, of course it bodes well for you to learn some of the intricacies of China and Brazil. But for the most part what we emphasize in cultural intelligence research is to say there’s a core set of capabilities that won’t allow you to be an expert at every culture where you go, but at least will allow you to jump in and do business effectively, think about some of the legal and economic components of whatever cultural context you’re finding yourself in so that you can develop marketing and negotiation strategies in light of this framework. \r\n You can hire and promote better in setting up manufacturing policy and distribution networks that retain your corporate standards while also adapting to local variables. And so the point of this is rather than thinking that you have to master all the information about every culture where you want to work, CQ is this overall capability and skill set that can be developed and applied quite broadly. \r\n So, that gives you just a quick overview of what I mean by the idea of cultural intelligence. This is certainly not a concept that’s just unique to me. There’s been dozens of academics and business professionals who have been working on this for a number of years from around the world, and perhaps we’ll talk a bit more about that later on. \r\n So, that’s in a nutshell what cultural intelligence is. Without getting too academic on you, let me just share briefly how it is that we actually measure cultural intelligence. How do we make something as subjective as being adaptable and effective in lots of different cultural context something that can be more empirically measured? And there are four capabilities that you see described for you on the PowerPoint slide that really capture how we go about assessing and measuring cultural intelligence, both in overall businesses and then specifically in individuals. \r\n We have an actual assessment, a diagnostic tool that I might mention somewhat to a bit later that actually is the mechanical way that we do this. But let me just give you a brief introduction to what each of these four capabilities has to with (it), because I think most of us will readily identify with what it’s getting at from just your own business experience and that. \r\n Number 1, CQ drive. What we’re trying to get at here is the individual’s level of interest, motivation, and confidence that they can actually get involved in international business. And, this is one of the most overlapped aspects when it comes to international success. Case-in-point, when we think about things like the National Export Initiative. For many businesses, the primary thing that they’re interested in thinking about is not so much teach me all the customs and norms of a different culture, but can I make more money here? Or, am I going to get sued or find myself in a very difficult ethical dilemma in some place that I want to go? \r\n And so what we’re trying to get at here is asking what’s the motivation in the first place, and how do we actually get at that? Because what we’ve found is a number of companies often jump right into training people and teaching them about cultural differences without really telling them in the first place how this actually connects with them being successful in their work. \r\n So perhaps an individual is being placed overseas on an expat assignment. I find that those individuals are usually far more concerned about the living conditions, where their kids are going to go to school, how they’re going to get around than they are on learning all the intricacies of how culture effects the way business is done. \r\n So after they get there, they tend to be far more motivated to learn about those things. So many times companies will spend a lot of money on going through training on cross-cultural awareness and that. If they haven’t addressed the motivation issue, it might be money that’s not well spent. Or perhaps we send someone overseas to sell our product, or to launch a franchise, or to find a new distributor somewhere. \r\n Again, we’re often more concerned about finding a good system for distribution or accountability that will work well rather than thinking about the importance of going out for dinner and having some of the social conversations with people. But, it might in point be that those social conversations actually have far more to do with landing a good contract than some of the actual official business meetings. And so, the reason I mention that again here is if we understand that it helps motivate us to think about what we’re doing in the first place. \r\n And so the first thing that we’re interested in both assessing and then developing with individuals wanting to do international business is what’s their drive? What’s their motivation for doing this in the first place? \r\n The second piece gets to what we more often think about in cross-cultural training, and that’s knowledge. But again, true to the model that I’ve already described you, we don’t spend a whole lot of time talking about all the specifics of every different culture that we could possibly go to, because again, that just becomes overwhelming. But rather to talk about an overall understanding of ways that most cultures tend to differ. \r\n And so, here we do draw from a lot of the helpful work that’s been done by people like (Trumpanairs), and (Hoffsteed), and (Schwartz), and many others who will talk about the difference in power orientations. Who’s in charge, who’s in control, and how important is it to respect that when you’re negotiating a deal. The difference in terms of how trust is developed, or how a time orientation is approached. So, that’s what we’re getting at with CQ knowledge. \r\n And again, our emphasis here is not so much learning all the norms and customs about various cultures, because most of the business people I meet simply don’t have time to keep up with all that. And furthermore, some of the greatest potential of the National Export Initiative exists in places like Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, Brazil where we hardly have a monocultural group of people that can be figured out that we should send them through a bunch of complex workshops and books on, but rather can they adapt on the fly? \r\n Maybe just a quick illustration on this. I had a friend call me up a couple months ago who is another American business person, and he said, “Okay Dave, my company wants to send me to Dubai. I’ve never been to the UAE. Tell me what I need to know about the culture there.” And I said, “Well. Okay my friend. The first thing you need to understand is 80% of the expat community in Dubai are people from - or I’m sorry, 80% of the working community in Dubai are people who are expats, who are from a variety of different cultures around the world.” \r\n So, what culture should he learn? I mean surely, he should understand a few things about Arabian culture and the way that that may influence things there, but when he sits down in his first meeting, he may be sitting with a German, and Aussie, a Korean, a Chinese, a Saudi, and on and on it goes. And clearly, he can’t suddenly pull out is lonely planet guide for all those different countries at that point. \r\n So once again, forgive me if I am underscoring this too much, but the point being more in developing an overall cultural understanding of how culture impacts the way business is done, we’ve found that to be the capability that actually translates more into the success that people have in earning profits as they go about doing their work. \r\n Just briefly, the other two capabilities. Not only do we look at drive and knowledge, the third one is strategy. This is the degree to which the individual is aware of what occurs in a cross-cultural situation and their ability to plan accordingly. So maybe you have someone who’s very motivated, who’s just naturally curious about different cultures, or maybe they’re very motivated and believe that there’s great market potential in another culture, so they might have high CQ drive. Maybe they actually have all kinds of understanding in terms of cultural understanding CQ knowledge. \r\n But, the third one really becomes the linchpin as to whether or not it’s going to be successful for you or not. Can you actually develop a strategy that allows you to retain your core values of your business, but also adapt to the local customs and flavors that are there. And so what we’re getting at with Number 3 is do I have the ability to translate my understanding and motivation into something that will actually be a good plan? \r\n This is some of the most challenging process that we face, because it’s one thing to know what to do when a corporation requires a lengthy document. But what do you do in a place where the legal document doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot and a hand shake or the conversation over tea and rice is actually where the real negotiating is done? And so, the strategy is the ability to deal with corporate expectations back home while also dealing with some of the local expectations that exist in a place where we go. \r\n So under CQ strategy, we’re both assessing and helping companies develop an awareness of what’s being said and what’s not being said, and then to use that information to develop effective negotiation strategies, marketing plans, HR policies, et cetera. \r\n And then finally, rubber meets the road CQ action is can an individual actually get results for you? Or, can you personally get results? This is having the ability to know when should you flex your plan? When should you flex your policies, your marketing strategy, and when frankly should you not do that because it will no longer be true to who you are and what you’re trying to sell there? And so, can you actually execute? Can you adapt your behavior in a way that’s authentic and remains true to your business core values, but also do so in a way that’s respectful and as importantly, helpful in to actually making money and bringing about opportunity for your business there? \r\n So, that’s how we measure whether or not someone has CQ. There’s been rigorous research. I won’t take you through all the academic empirical findings today, but there’s been more than 60 academic journals that have reported on the research that says this is actually a valid way of finding a proven way for people to have results. \r\n There’s a couple other slides that I want to draw your attention to though as it relates to how we measure CQ, because as I interact with business people, frankly they’re not as concerned about all the academic findings about how we assess CQ in individuals. The bottom line question becomes, “Okay. If I actually prioritize cultural intelligence for myself or for other individuals, what’s the return on investment?” I mean after all, that is why we’re in business, to seek to make products that are helpful to people and help the bottom line, and produce well for shareholders, for a public company. \r\n And, I’m not going to walk through all the things that are on this return on investment slide, but I just point your attention to it to suggest we have studies that have been done on all these different areas to say there are tangible returns on investment, bottom-line kinds of ways that companies and individuals that have higher levels of CQ have found actual dividends being paid to them in all these different areas. \r\n And so while I won’t go into all those right now, I do want to draw your attention to a few of the key areas of return on investment shown to you on this next slide, and I’ll talk about these a bit more specifically and concretely. So once again, what we’re saying is for companies that we saw that were led by leaders with higher levels of CQ, these were places where we saw a significant difference in what was going on for them in terms of return on investment. We’re going to give you some specifics as it relates to these three things that you see there on that slide. \r\n First of all is profitability. Let me talk about one study we did related to this. There were 100 multinational companies that we worked with that did an 18 month project with us where we assessed the CQ of individuals and the firms as a whole at the front end of those 18 months. Did so again at the back end of those 18 months. And then, we also looked at their P\u0026amp;L sheets with their permission at the beginning of the 18 months and the end of it. \r\n And from the 100 companies that were a part of this research project for 18 months, we found 18 months later, 92% of them found that they had increased revenues. In fact, some of them had almost 100% increased revenues. And of all of the 92% that saw increased revenues, all of them attributed cultural intelligence as a significant contributor to what happened for them. \r\n Now, I will be the first to say by no means it’s the only thing that they did right for those 18 months, enhanced their cultural intelligence. Obviously in order to perform well and have increased profitability, it requires much more than cultural intelligence. So, I’m not interested in being a one trick pony who just sells you on the silver bullet -- to mix metaphors -- of cultural intelligence to say this is the end-all. \r\n But, it’s an important piece to have in your toolbox for thinking about export initiatives to say that the companies self-reported that cultural intelligence played a very significant role for them in seeing increased return on investment in the kinds of things that happened for them when they enhanced their cultural intelligence. And as it might be of interest to you, of these 100 companies that we studied, they included all kinds of industries. So we had manufacturing, we had pharmaceuticals. We had energy companies, financial services, hospitality organizations, service companies. \r\n And, we found that some of the largest companies involved in this study were particularly using cultural intelligence with their top leaders to deal with their bourgeoning operations across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, the Americas, and the Middle East. And, they found that cultural intelligence was helping them have an increased level of local ownership across their widespread global force. \r\n They found that there was enhanced customer service and client relationship as a result of the increased attention on cultural intelligence. And for many of them, they found that it led to them having an altered marketing strategy, which also led to increased revenue for them. \r\n So, all of these are some various ways that profitability was correlated for them in the whole idea of when they enhanced cultural intelligence doing it. So as we noted earlier, with 70 million new people entering the so-called middle class every year, there’s all kinds of revenue potential that exists in these emerging markets. And, the companies with the highest level of CQ seems to be doing the best at tapping into this middle class that’s related to that. \r\n So, that’s all under the subset of profitability. Much more needs to be understood there. We’ve also looked at some of the individual salary levels of individuals with higher levels of CQ, just as the emotional intelligence research has done. But, much more needs to be understood there. \r\n The second return on investment that seemed to be some of the most noteworthy findings on it was improved management. And so, we found that increased CQ led to people managing with a higher degree of effectiveness. So as you know well, managing a diverse and dispersed team requires a whole new skill set that requires an understanding of what kind of feedback you’re getting from people, especially if a lot of your management is done through Internet, Web, through conference calls like this one. \r\n And what we found was managers with higher levels of CQ correlated with the 360 kinds of feedback that they were getting from the people that they managed. And, managers with higher levels of CQ made better business decisions. Their risk calculations were more accurate. They better understood the needs and trends of the market and they better knew how to motivate personnel who were coming from a variety of different cultures. \r\n One study that we looked at looked at a CEO’s level of confidence and how that connected with their CQ, and we found that a low CQ often correlated with an exaggerated sense of self-confidence, which led to investment distortion, venture failure, and all kinds of other things. So again, the point being that there’s a very tangible outcome for people of when they enhance their CQ they see it play it out in the way that people are managed. \r\n And then, the last one that I’ll mention to you is the way that CQ helps companies attract and retain top talent. With the job market beginning to rebound in many places around the world, attracting and retaining talent is once again an area for concern for many organizations that are really trying to tap the international workplace as well as market. \r\n Perhaps you saw just last week the article that was in Newsweek that was reporting the increased competition for management talent that happens particularly in places like China and India. There is a absence of people that are ready to do that. And so because of that, there’s a high level of competition going after the people who are top talent. \r\n And so, this is probably the area where practically we do the most work with companies, where they’re incorporating cultural intelligence development and assessment into some of their accelerated management programs for young, high capacity emerging leaders who really have a desire to be engaged in international business, in companies who are really investing in helping them develop and assess that for the work that they do. \r\n In particular, we find that the younger generation is looking for employers that value corporate social responsibilities and priorities that lead to helping them behave with cultural intelligence. One study that we did found that 78% of leaders 40 years of age and under actually said they would accept 10% less pay to work at a company that prioritized corporate social responsibility and cultural intelligence than a company that didn’t emphasize those things. \r\n Now admittedly, if they were offered two jobs with that kind of salary difference in front of them, only time would tell whether or not that would actually be a true difference. But the point comes that they would actually - they demonstrate that they would - that this was a priority to them that was more important than just the actual income that they would make. \r\n So much more needs to be looked at in terms of the return of investment for cultural intelligence, but clearly the initial findings are very promising for how cultural intelligence translates into bottom-line growth. And as globalization continues, this is likely to increase the importance of a capability like cultural intelligence. \r\n Finally - okay, so what do we do with all this? So, I’m kind of landing on some next steps for individuals who are interested in thinking about this, and then would love to have some time where we have dialog together to field some of your questions related to this. One thing that we need to do as it relates to this is four steps to increasing the overall personal cultural intelligence. \r\n The four capabilities that I walked you through have actually been found as also four steps to thinking about how increase CQ. One way for us to think about that is not only how do we assess people through this, but it’s to say in some ways this can be a cyclical process by which we help people walk it through. So, on the first end is CQ drive asking the question what’s someone’s motivation for this assignment? So, we’ve already walked through these four, but we’re trying to say when you come alongside someone, this is actually a way to help them develop it as well. \r\n So, if you’re trying to talk to a colleague about how you get involved in international business, again before just talking to talk to them about all legal and trade policies, or cultural differences and understanding, the first thing would be for us to ask them, “What’s your motivation? Why is this important to us as a company?” \r\n Again, the second one I don’t need to repeat for you what we mean by CQ knowledge, but then just to help them say, “Okay. What’s some of the understanding in need in order to be successful with this?” Thirdly, “What’s my plan to do this?” And fourthly, “How should I adapt?” \r\n And so, we work with a number of companies in terms of saying these four steps are not only four that we assess, but they can actually be a four step process that we use to think about how we approach training and assessment. \r\n It can be a four step process that we use on the fly. We’re going to meet with a potential customer who comes from a different country quickly, on the fly, in the car, on the train on the way there. What’s our motivation? What’s the understanding we need? What’s our plan? How should we adapt? Or it may be a more macro strategy, that before we jump into a major initiative, helps us to think through how we do that. So that’s just a revisit. This four - these four capabilities are saying there can be four steps for responding to CQ. \r\n Then, you'll see some of the other ones that are related here. Some of them are rather obvious, but assessment and education. So, what are ways to actually assess and educate in the way of doing this. I think one of the first ways to assess ourselves and others in cultural intelligence just tends to be to better understand what the four capabilities are talking about. \r\n So because some of this is fairly subjective, as you better understand what we’re talking about with CQ drive, CQ knowledge, CQ strategy, and CQ action, you can begin to ask in yourself, “Hey, yes. What is my motivation? What’s my general understanding? What’s my ability to develop a strategy and how do I engage in that?” When you’re interviewing someone or when you’re interacting with people through conversation, you can begin to pick up on that. \r\n But, we do have some more tangible ways to assess that as well. If you were to visit the Web site, I’ll give this to you again later on one of the slides, but www.culturalq.com. You'll see there are a variety of assessments that are available to actually walk people through assessing their CQ. Both self-assessments that are available for a small fee and then 360 assessments that are available for people. \r\n Some of the universities we work with are actually getting involved in assessing people in workplaces through some interesting visual tracking software too, where they’ll watch international business incidents and get a picture into how people would solve those. So without getting to technical about it, I’m just trying to demonstrate there are lots of different ways to assess this in people to help quantify something that’s been fairly objective, and then to develop education that gets at that. \r\n So instead of just having a one-size-fits-all approach to how you educate yourself or others on this, to say, “Maybe you’re drive is fine so you don’t need to be motivated. But instead, what are some of the specific educational needs that you have for CQ knowledge?” Or, perhaps it’s vice versa. \r\n The third one I just mentioned. Increasing their individuals who are getting certified in the cultural intelligence research area. That allows them to actually go in and work with other companies on assessing and develop that. So, that’s another piece to bear in mind. Or, simply having people in your company if you’re a bit larger company that can actually work with helping other people enhance their cultural intelligence. \r\n The third one - fourth one -- excuse me -- team development. Let it be no surprise that as you culturally diversify your own team, guess what. That allows you to better perform with cultural intelligence when you get into international export initiatives. So, we have a great deal of research that has said more ethnically diverse businesses and teams are obviously one -- or it seems obvious to me -- are obviously businesses who then do better internationally because they benefit from the input of those people. \r\n Of course, that presumes that you tap into the different ethnic perspectives that are represented there. So, team development is an important piece in saying how do we learn from the differences that exist on our team and use that, rather than seeing it as just a way to deal with diversity issues in the workplace, but also to tap into some of the opportunity internationally. \r\n And finally, strategic use of CQ throughout the business. What I mean by that is many times we think about international export as a topic that’s entirely separate from diversity training. \r\n And what we’re finding is when we use this macro framework, whether it’s cultural intelligence or perhaps you have a different approach that works better for you. But when there’s a single model that kind of captures the way that you deal with cultural difference, it really starts to make it something that’s more than just the flavor of the month, but really starts to drive the way that you do business. \r\n And so when your HR people, and your sales people, and your marketing people, and your accounting department are all kind of thinking through this similar language of “What’s our team motivation? Why is this an important value to us?” As well as the other three capabilities that are done through CQ, we find that that tends to be a way that really begins to help us see greater return on investment for how we actually go into doing it. \r\n Just on a personal note, one of the reasons that I am so committed to doing quite a bit of interacting and teaching with people and writing about cultural intelligence is unlike what is believed about many aspects of our personality, CQ is believed to be malleable. That is anybody can lean to develop it. It certainly requires some level of self-interest on their own part to actually get engaged in it, but any leader or any person in a business who wants to gain a greater degree of cultural intelligence can become more culturally intelligent. \r\n So sometimes people will feel like they’re at a huge disservice because they didn’t get to grow up like our younger generation has today in a much more globalized context, or perhaps they’ve come from a very mono-cultural context, or perhaps they like me are a white male who’s saying, “Oh. You know, I’m the worst person to actually think about this. Well certainly, we may have some limitations that go with those things, but CQ can be learned by anyone. \r\n And so through some of these things that I’ve talked through in the last several minutes together, it’s believed and it’s found through research that anybody can actually enhance their cultural intelligence, increase their opportunities to benefit from things like the National Export Initiative, and best of all make the world a better place by the way that they interact with people. \r\n And so, that would be one of the key things that makes cultural intelligence a bit different from some of the other approaches to international business or to cultural competence. We’re interested both in how do we respect people, interact with our fellow human beings with dignity and honor, but at the same time how do we still do business, and do it in a way that attends to bottom line and behave in adaptable ways? \r\n So, we do want to look within and look at some of the concerns about ethnocentrism and some of the ways that may impede our opportunities to interact with people respectfully and for the sake of business. But - so also, we want to do this in a way that actually helps us behave in a way that will bring about results in terms of the bottom line for what we’re trying to accomplish through our business. \r\n So, that is the gist of what I wanted to give you in a nutshell, at least as a working understanding of what CQ is, some of the ways that we measure it, and some of the ways it has implications upon international ventures and expanding into that. I must confess that my preferred way of communicating is not having a one-way conversation, like Webinars often have us do at least at the front end. I’m much more interested in dialog and interaction. \r\n And so for sure, want to spend the remainder of the time that we have together fielding some of the questions that you have. And then, would invite interaction after the fact through Web site, email, social networking sites, other ways to continue the interaction from things that you’re learning, critiques that you might have, and questions that you have as you in the real world work place think about what it looks like for you to expand internationally. \r\n So Anthony, let me turn it back over to you as we seek to field some questions related to this. \r\n Anthony Hill: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, Dr. Livermore. That’s very interesting and a very relevant topic for this audience. As we try to increase exports in the United States, it’s so important for us all to learn about cultural intelligence. \r\n Now, if anyone wants to ask a question, the operator will moderate this. And in order to do that, you'll have to press star, 1 if you want to ask a question. Operator? \r\n Coordinator: Thank you, Mr. Hill. And at this time - if you would like to ask an audio question at this time, please press star, 1 on your touchtone phone. Please record your name clearly when prompted. To withdraw your question, please press star, 2. \r\n Once again if you would like to ask an audio question at this time, please press star, 1 on your touchtone phone. Please record your name clearly when prompted. \r\n One moment as I retrieve the first question. \r\n And, our first question comes from Mr. (Hector Maldanado). Mr. (Maldanado), your line is open sir. \r\n (Hector Maldanado): Dr. Livermore, thank you very much for the very interesting presentation. You had mentioned a study for 100 companies and their practices for their expatriates. I was wondering if that study is published anywhere? \r\n David Livermore: It’s not yet been published. Thank you for your question, (Hector). It’s not yet been published in an academic journal. We did have a Forbes piece published earlier this year that reported on that finding, and we’re in the midst of having the fuller - the findings of that study be published. So, we’re getting there. We just wrapped up the final part of that project the first - the very end of last year. \r\n (Hector Maldanado): All right. Thank you. And, if I could ask a follow-on question? \r\n David Livermore: Of course. \r\n (Hector Maldanado): Particularly as it refers to multinational companies that may have a multitude of expatriates deployed across the globe, do you have any data about not only that 18 month period and what happens in terms of the P\u0026amp;L, but more so in terms of the big investment that a multinational incurs when in sense an employee on an expatriate assignment? And, what happens long-term to that employee, in terms of you know, career progression and how the company utilize this - that employee’s - let’s say increased perspective or increased experience on the international setting? \r\n David Livermore: Great question. I’m going to try and hold myself back from opening the dike from the dam, because I could go on for the rest of our time just on this one because there are so many layers of importance to what you’re asking. \r\n First of all, I certainly don’t claim to be the one behind it, but there are reams of research on the whole idea of sending expats overseas and success and failure. And like anything of course, as I’m sure you know well, you can find lots of examples of both aspects where it’s worked really well, other’s where it hasn’t. \r\n And what I have found interesting - I don’t know if you've run into this (Hector), but some companies have wrongfully assumed - let’s see. We need to send an expat to China. Let’s just find a US born Chinese and presume they’ll be the best person for that assignment, because at least they’ve got a leg up on the cross-cultural understanding. \r\n And, it could be. I’m certainly not going to say that that puts them behind the case, but many times without a more rigorous assessment and development, it may not be that the color of one’s skin or their ethnic background actually makes them the best person whatsoever. So, most of our research has been more oriented towards saying let’s get beyond some of the superficial things that are there. \r\n Because to jump to another piece of your question that’s there, what happens long-term with these individuals - if all else is equal, we’ve found that when somebody has had expat experience or has worked in travel broadly overseas, if all else is equal, we would certainly expect that that would enhance their cultural intelligence over the long haul. \r\n However, perhaps some of you have experienced as I sometimes have - sometimes the worst individuals I’ve encountered are somebody who have spent so many years overseas, because they were insulated in an expat community and actually have a very myopic view of the world but think that they know it all, and then perpetuate that notion to perhaps more green people as it relates to doing it. \r\n Coming back more to the crux of your question. I would say most of the research literature that I respect that’s coming out on this topic today is moving much away from the high-levels of expenditures of uprooting people from here to do - or from any country to do long-term expat assignments, and are looking for local talent to hire and put in place. Because, they obviously already understand the culture and instead are looking at more itinerate approaches of using people from here to inculcate the local - the business specific values. \r\n Or, perhaps to do a reverse version of it. To bring someone say from Saudi Arabia and put them in-house in a US company here for a year to help them take on the values, but then expect that they’re going to have a far better idea of how to live those values out when they get back to their local context. \r\n So, those are just a few observations and impressions. But, I think it’s going to continue to be interesting, because you’re right. The sheer cost alone is easily in millions of dollars to put a US person overseas for even a one to two year assignment when you calculate all that goes into that. So, there’s a lot of reasons why companies need to look very carefully about whether or not that’s the best way for them to go. \r\n (Hector Maldanado): No, thank you for your answer. And, what I had observed obviously a small sample is that many companies do not provide any type of cultural awareness training on expatriate employees. And then secondly, I’ve also started hearing through friends in the industry that a lot of companies are cutting back or altogether canceling expatriate assignments. \r\n David Livermore: I hear the same thing. And what I would say to your first point is in a positive realm, the companies that I see doing it well, that is training and preparing their people, actually are not so focused on pre-departure training, because I think I had mentioned early on in our presentation today I find a lot of expats are going, “Yes. Right now, I’m just trying to figure out where I’m going to send my kids to school, or how my spouse is going to find meaning when they get there,” kind of thing. \r\n But three months into being there, or six months in are suddenly going, “Oh, wow. I really, really wish I had paid more attention during that cultural training that was offered.” So, we’re finding that the companies that are doing it well are not necessarily front loading a bunch of training, but are looking for ways to provide - whether it’s through e-learning seminars or site specific training three months and six months in, where they now have - it kind of gets back to that CQ drive piece. Individuals with a whole different level of motivation to pay attention to it. \r\n Coordinator: And, our next question comes from Mr. (Doug Berry). Mr. (Berry), your line is open. \r\n (Doug Berry): Thank you very much, David. That was really fascinating. And, I just wanted to share with you one little personal experience, and then also ask a question. \r\n David Livermore: Great. Thanks, (Doug). \r\n (Doug Berry): And, it is regarding a long time relationship with Japan. And recently, the head of this organization came to town and asked specifically to meet with me, and I did and we had a very nice dinner. And, he made all of these very interesting proposals which would involve traveling there and doing some work for his organization. \r\n And then when I followed up a few weeks afterwards I got a completely different feeling from him, and it was, “Oh, I’m going to have to talk to my colleagues here, and we have to discuss. It’s not on the work plan for this year. Maybe the following year.” \r\n And, my first reaction was you know, a little bit of anger. It was like, “Well, you’re the boss. Just go ahead and make the commitment.” And, I don’t have time to sit around for a year waiting for this thing to happen. And you know, “How come you were so interested in the night that we met, and now suddenly it’s gone cold?” \r\n And of course you know, I realized that this is sort of the Japanese consensus making, and he will have to go back and he’ll have to talk to people and they’ll have to have multiple meetings before they can finally come to a conclusion. But even though I knew these things, I almost blundered by saying things and writing him emails that I would’ve regretted later. \r\n And, I just wonder you know how does one go about reflecting on their own cultural ways of doing things? And so that one can you know, be more reflective of how they interact with other people so they can be more effective in these kinds of dealings? \r\n David Livermore: Excellent question, (Doug). And, I know from our previous interactions that you certainly have your own extensive share of experiences living abroad and working internationally. And, I think that in part is what caused you to not respond the way that you did. \r\n I meant that as a positive. For you to respond as you did - hesitated rather than sending the email. And obviously, you’re well aware that (Doug) because of your own work, but just as a reminder to all of us -- and I have to continue to remind myself as much as I swim in this literature -- that the Japanese colleague with whom you were sitting, in some regards from an Asian collectivist mindset, the only right answer when you were having dinner together was yes, because yes to many in that culture is to say, “I don’t want to do anything to let you down right now. I want to save face.” \r\n And of course in my very American way, I’d say, “Well, you’re going to let me down more if you change the story a week from now,” but that’s because I’m coming at it from my American bias. But as you've noted well, clearly that’s probably not his place to even make that decision. \r\n At the risk of just patronizing you (Doug), I think case in point of what needs to happen is what you did. You hesitated before you responded. One of the things - a very simple phrase that I continually remind myself of when I’m interacting cross-culturally in traveling is notice, don’t respond, and eventually I have to respond. \r\n But many, many times, I want to fire off that email of frustration. But to purposely draft it and let it sit in my inbox, perhaps I’d be well suited to even do that with my similar cultural background colleagues if I’m upset by something. But particularly when it’s a different culture, to perhaps sit on it. Leave it in the draft box. Come back to it tomorrow and think now, is there something deeper that’s going beyond here? \r\n So in one way - I’m really talking around this question here. I guess what I would like to say to all of you is in one way I’ve tried to present a fairly accessible approach to how we use cultural intelligence to apply to the kinds of situations like (Doug) has recounted. \r\n On the other hand, I would be doing a (disservice) if I were to suggest to any of us that, “Oh, it’s just as simple as walk through these four steps and you'll be good to go.” It is often times years and years of us making mistakes, blunders, and then stepping back and going, “Oh. Now I know what was going on in that situation.” \r\n And frankly, I’m okay with that. I don’t think any of us are going to do it flawlessly. But, the very fact that you stepped back and ask the question I think is a key part that’s related to that. \r\n Coordinator: And, our next question comes from Mr. (Todd Cornell). Mr. (Cornell), your line is open, sir. \r\n (Todd Cornell): Hi. Thank you very much Mr. Livermore. I appreciate your cultural intelligence and sharing it with everybody. \r\n I just wanted to make a couple of comments. I spent 20 years in China, and so I kind of have an understanding for what you were talking about as far as hiring somebody who would be a local - a ABC if you will. Somebody who was born and raised in America and who’s Chinese. You would stop and think, “Yes. This is the obvious person.” Well then go with this as that bridge to China and interacting with China. \r\n But, it actually goes in another direction when you stop and think about - with China, you've got Hong Kongese. You’ve got Taiwanese. You've got people from Singapore. And we here don’t stop and think about the different variations within that. You take somebody from the US who’s from Taiwan or even was educated in the US to China, and you’re probably going to create more problems than if you took somebody over there who didn’t speak a word of Chinese. \r\n And another thing too, is it’s about hiring somebody over there. I’ve hired a lot of Chinese locally and trained them. The one thing that you have to really be careful of is making sure that they understand the corporate mentality and the corporate ideas of the US company that they’re working for. And, that’s the one thing that I had to do a lot of training for, was to make sure that they understood clearly what our company mission is and what our company values and ideas are. And, that may not always set well with their own culture. And so training them and educating in that I found to be very important. \r\n So, I think everything you’re bringing out here is just really wonderful, and that I really appreciate what you’re saying as far as finding that core ability to be able to interact with many different cultures, like you were talking about for Saudi Arabia, or I think it was Dubai. And, that is so important. And, that’s something that I think is - it’s a sense. It’s a - it’s being able to read people and it’s being able to see things in a way going beyond your own self. \r\n And one thing that I find that is so important in being able to understand other cultures, and I think that’s understanding the languages. \r\n David Livermore: Yes. \r\n (Todd Cornell): And, I think language is so important in understanding other cultures. \r\n David Livermore: Absolutely. It’s - just a couple quick comments, (Todd). Thank you for that. And, I would wholeheartedly agree with your point in terms of the multiple directions the Chinese thing can go. And point of fact, have heard from numerous Chinese CEOs who have actually said it’s a bigger stumbling block for me to get over working with a Houston born Chinese or a Singaporean, or a London than it is to deal with a 100% Swede person who doesn’t think they know China at all. \r\n And, I certainly don’t want oversimplify and say that that’s always the case. But, the point being that yes again, there’s so much more to it as it relates to that. \r\n And the other comment I want to make that your point reminded me of is you talked about how you have dealt over 20-some years there in China of teaching your own culture values is cultural intelligence is a two way street. That’s one of the things that we often talk about. \r\n It’s not just - granted, we - the onus is on us for all of the reasons that ugly American has often fit us in learning to be the ones who seek to understand and respect other cultures. But so also for other cultures to understand who we really are beyond perhaps their perceptions of who we are, and then also as it relates to who are companies are. \r\n (Todd Cornell): Thank you. \r\n David Livermore: Thank you, (Todd). \r\n Coordinator: And at this time there are no other questions in the queue. \r\n Anthony Hill: Dr. Livermore, this is Anthony Hill. I have a quick question. Hopefully it’s quick. I was wondering how has the cultural intelligence of the US in general changed over time? And do you have information on that? \r\n David Livermore: Yes. We very purposely have not aggregated our results and data specific to geographical regions because we don’t want to start to perpetuate some parts of the world are more culturally intelligent than others. \r\n So from a pure empirical note. I’m going to say that what I’m about to say is not really evidence-based. It’s more just my intuitive impression. I do think regardless of where people fall politically, that over the last couple of years there has been a more welcoming sense of who we are as Americans. That may be well founded or it may not be, but just the perception of - okay, there’s being language that’s used from the current Administration about being global citizens and part of the larger conversation of the world. \r\n So, I am finding that there’s a greater receptivity again that we haven’t seen for awhile. But there’s a lot for us to compensate for that, because what I’m finding among many individuals that I interact with who are trying to tap into emerging economies -- from Americans -- are saying many time they’re put at the back of the line. That someone who’s say in Vietnam from China, or somebody who’s trying to get a Vietnam firm to work with them from the Middle East are put at the front of the line. \r\n And, the assumption is there’s a disadvantage from the US. So, we may have to overcompensate our sense of cultural intelligence to again be given a listening ear to what we’re trying to do. \r\n Anthony Hill: Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: And, we did have a question join late. Would you like to take the question at this time? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yes. \r\n Coordinator: And, it comes from (Hector Maldanado). Mr. (Maldanado), your line is open, sir. \r\n (Hector Maldanado): Dr. Livermore, one last question that comes to mind with the recent experience that Toyota has had here in the United States with the safety crisis. It seems like - I’m just wondering if you have any comments in the light of cultural - the cultural awareness of a Japanese multinational handling a crisis in the United States. \r\n David Livermore: Yes. I think there are - thanks for another great question. I think there are so many variables going on, so I certainly don’t want to reduce the whole thing to cultural intelligence. And, I would defer to many other business experts who have talked about - you know, did they take their eye off the ball in the midst of success? \r\n But, I think there is a cultural layer to what’s going on here, where our value as a US public is so highly oriented toward wanting our leaders to be transparent, that you saw the frustration of that and you’re seeing it again with BP. Where there are many other cultures that would say, “Oh. You’re disrespecting the whole idea of leadership to do your dirty laundry in public.” \r\n So, there’s much more going on to it than that, but I do think the ability to respond to critique and criticism in a saving face culture as compared to our culture that’s much more about you know, tell me my bottom-line value, admit that you were wrong kind of thing that was coming into play there. \r\n Coordinator: And at this time, there are no other questions in the queue. \r\n Anthony Hill: Well, thank you very much everyone. It’s really been an enlightening hour, and very interesting information Dr. Livermore. We really appreciate your time and all of the great insights that you've provided today. \r\n David Livermore: Thank you so much. Privileged to be a part of this today. \r\n Anthony Hill: Everyone, thank you very much and you know hopefully, this has helped you improve your cultural intelligence. Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. And at this time, you call has concluded. You may disconnect at this time. \r\n Once again, your call has concluded. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a great day. \r\n   \r\n END ","pub_date":"2013-05-13","title":"Improving Your Cultural Intelligence: Part 1","update_date":"2013-05-15","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["Market Research"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["Cutural Intelligence"]},{"id":"465","content":" Combustion Associates of Corona, California is a small business created by immigrants from Bangladesh.

I would also like to remind participants that today's conference is being recorded, if anyone has any objections you may disconnect at this time. \r\n And now I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Patrick McRae. Sir, you may begin. \r\n Patrick McRae: Hello everyone, good morning and good afternoon. My name is Pat McRae. I'm an International Trade Specialist with the US Department of Commerce, the US Commercial Service and a member of our Global Design and Construction Team. \r\n We're delighted to have you joining us today for the discussion on reconstruction opportunities in Haiti. We're fortunate to have some excellent speakers joining us that have generously offered to share their knowledge and expertise on the Haitian market, the current situation there and opportunities available for US companies. \r\n Before launching into the Webinar content I'd like to take just a couple minutes to define the Commercial Service for those of you that might not be familiar with us and also further define the Global Design and Construction Team then we'll introduce our speakers and go over a few housekeeping items. \r\n The US Commercial Service is the trade promotion arm of the US Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration. We are the premier federal export promotion agency. We are located in over 100 cities and in 80 countries. \r\n Our mission is simple and it's - we exist in order to facilitate the export of US products and services; that's why we exist to help you export your products and services to (unintelligible) markets overseas. \r\n Some of the services that our staff domestically and overseas provide include development of international marketing strategies, obtaining market and industry research, helping you identify strategic partners perhaps representatives, sales agents, distributors, JV partners, that sort of thing in international markets. \r\n We provide one on one export counseling and due diligence services to help you look into the background of your potential partners. You tell us what you need with respect to your export objectives; we can develop customized services and programs that will help you accomplish those. We are here to help you at every stage of the export assistance - of the export process. \r\n Now within the Department of - within the Commercial Service groups of specialists organize themselves into teams with specific industry focus. Within the Commercial Service we have the Global Design and Construction Team which is a group of industry-focused staff that serve and support the US design and construction industry with international business development. \r\n Our Website is listed there and we invite you to visit our Website to get some more insight on our activities. And I'd also like to mention that we are now available on Twitter and our Twitter address is cs_designteam and I want to invite you to join us there as well. \r\n Now moving along to today's production, having completed the introduction portion we will hear from two speakers, Bob Jones and Mac Tadeu and then we'll have a question and answer sessions. \r\n Now I'd like to introduce our first speaker, Bob Jones, who is the currently the Regional Commercial Counselor for the Caribbean Region based at the US embassy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. \r\n Prior to being assigned to the Dominican Republic Bob was the Commercial Counselor at the US embassy in Panama and before Panama he was the Counsel for Commercial Affairs at the US Consulate General in Vancouver, Canada. \r\n From 1998 to 2011 Bob served as the Commercial Attaché at the US Embassy in Quito, Ecuador and served as the Counsel for Commercial Affairs in Monterey Mexico from 1994 to 1998. Before entering the Commercial Service in 1994 Bob managed international programs for three major US trade associations. \r\n As the son of a foreign service officer Bob grew up in Lahore, Pakistan from 1965 to 1970 and later graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in international relations and economics and later obtained his MBA in international management from the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Phoenix. \r\n Our next speaker will be Americo, Mac, Tadeu and he is currently the Director of Business Liaison to the Inter-American Development Bank, the IDB, in Washington Dc. \r\n His mandate is to assist US companies to identify opportunities in doing business with the IDB. Prior to coming to Washington he served as the Commercial Counselor at the US embassy in Santiago, Chile. He also served from 1999 to 2002 as the Action Regional Director for East Asia Pacific Region of the US Commercial Service in Washington DC overseeing one of the most dynamic regions of the globe for our Service. \r\n Mac has also served as the Deputy Senior Commercial Officer at the US Commercial Service embassy in Brasilia, Brazil. And prior to Brazil Mac was the Senior Commercial Office in Panama for two years and prior to that the Principal Commercial Officer at the Consulate General in Guadalajara, Mexico. \r\n Mac has his masters in - his MA in international affairs from the School of International Service at the American University in Washington DC and a BA from Drew University located in Madison, New Jersey. So as you can see we have some significant expertise here to give you a perspective on opportunities in the region. \r\n And with that being said I'll - oh final note, at the end of the presentation we will have a question and answer session. You will have an opportunity to submit both verbal and text or email questions. If you're not able to get your question through you may email Terri Batch whose contact information appears on the registration documents that you submitted. With that I'll be happy to turn it over to Bob Jones. \r\n Bob Jones: Thank you very much Pat, appreciate it. And thanks to you and to Terri for all of your hard work in putting this program together today. Let's see now. Now this - let's see - now the slides - I've still got your slides here Pat, on the left. Oh here we go, okay. \r\n Patrick McRae: Let me get - to yours? \r\n Bob Jones: Yeah, there we go. Okay now we've got it here, perfect. Okay well I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I know we have a number of people on the call that have participated in some other programs that we've organized in regards to Haiti so I apologize if I'm a little repetitious for some of you but the idea is to give information to people which could be valuable and you can follow up with specific questions either after the program today or if you don't get a chance to do it then via email. If you send it to Terri Batch she'll forward it onto myself and/or Mac. \r\n Just before I start talking about Haiti - and I know we don't have a lot of time today - we want plenty of time for questions so just going to touch briefly on the idea of looking at the Caribbean region when we talk about Haiti not just Haiti. And of course these PowerPoint slides will be available for you as well later on to refer to so I don't need to go into a lot of detail. \r\n But basically our Commercial Service office based in the Dominican Republic covers the Caribbean region. So in addition to being able to offer our Commercial Service market development program to US companies for the DR we also have what we call partner post arrangements with other US embassies, the economic sections in those embassies in four other islands where we can also offer you our Commercial Service programs. \r\n That includes the Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago. Now the reason I'm not mentioning Haiti in that list is because we do not currently have any staff or arrangement in Haiti to better provide our services. \r\n The good news is that we are currently in the process of identifying and hiring a contractor who we will have based in Port-au-Prince probably within the American Chamber of Commerce office there who will be able to work with us and US companies to provide services such as contact lists, setting up appointments, market research, etcetera. \r\n So that should be coming down the road shortly. And as soon as that person is in place we will advise everybody. And we also hope that happens sometime in September. \r\n And we looked at the region as opposed to just the DR or Haiti. The Caribbean as a region is pretty significant. Last year exports had dropped to the region just because of the overall economic problems worldwide but this year again it's over $20 billion of US products and services and well over $40 billion in products and services worldwide that are exported to the Caribbean. \r\n The other thing I want to mention is now when we're talking about the Caribbean region companies should certainly have a regional plan or strategy so you don't want to just look at one market. There are a variety of markets, different sizes, cultures and languages spoken, etcetera so it can be a little confusing. \r\n But we have our Website which is listed at the end of the presentation and you can go to that and get information about the different markets and also working with your local US export assistance centers people such as Terri and Pat are in those local offices around the country. They can also give you information about our programs. \r\n But when you're looking at the region certainly you want to look at also Espanola as an overall market; you don't want to just think of Haiti or the Dominican Republic; these are integrated markets just by the very fact that they share the same geographical area. \r\n And traditionally over the years for historical reasons they have not had a great deal of cooperation and joint economic developments so their economies have not been very well synched together. But since the earthquake there has a been a real (unintelligible) change in that regard where the Dominican government as well as the business community now is very actively trying to establish more links and relationships with their counterparts across the island of Espanola in Haiti. \r\n And the Haitians also are reaching out to the Dominicans. So a lot of times when you're doing business in this region on this island you will find for instance you might be working with a distributor in Santo Domingo or business partner who's also going to be doing business in Haiti or vice versa so you want to look at both sides of the island when you think about this market. \r\n We all know about of course the devastating earthquake on January 12. This earthquake destroyed 120% of the entire gross domestic product of Haiti which is really an historical disaster. There's really been no other natural disaster on record that has destroyed 120% of a countries economy. So really is not rebuilding Haiti it's building a new Haiti in every sense of the word. \r\n Now on March 31 there was the well-known donor's conference in New York that the United Nations sponsored. And at that time over $9 - close to really $10 billion was pledged by 59 different donor countries to donate money into a fund that would be used for the building of a new Haiti. \r\n Now the trick is even though that money was pledged less than 10% of it has actually been disbursed at this point. That's one of the reasons that there've been some delay in moving some of these projects forward and we'll talk about other reasons for that as well. \r\n Now there's a couple of places where you can look for a number of the documents I'm going to be discussing but one of them is this Website, haiticonference.org where you can find the action plan for national recovery and development of Haiti. And that document is also on some other sites as well. \r\n But this is a good overall plan to give you a feel for what is the general plan for building a new Haiti because we're talking about all sectors of the economy, all businesses and industries and so it really is something much more complex than you normally have with disasters in other countries. \r\n And there's a number of different organizations that are involved in the various aspects of the building of a new Haiti; we'll be talking about some of them shortly here one of them being Inter-American Development Bank which of course I'm not going to touch on since Mac will be doing a very good job covering that. \r\n But the complaint we often get from US companies is that there's no one place to go to to get all the information at once about participating in projects to rebuild Haiti and that's because there is no single source of information. So you really have to do your homework, you have to work with a number of different organizations. \r\n Also depending on what your objectives or goals are you have to approach it in different ways depending for instance if it's a large company you might be looking for primary contracts or if it's a small company looking for subcontracting opportunities that would be another approach as well. \r\n But just to start off at the first organization here, the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission, this commission was formed at the March 31 donor's conference. And the idea was to put together a commission made up of representatives from the Haitian government as well as representatives from the donor community and other organizations as well as the Haitian Diaspora, the NGO community, etcetera to have an overview and a process in terms of reviewing projects, approving projects, supervising and monitoring projects. \r\n So this commission is the single most important organization in terms of that almost $10 billion being spent on projects if that money comes through. Even if all of it doesn't a significant amount of it it will certainly in the medium term. As a result this Website is very instrumental in terms of getting information about a lot of projects that are going to be moving forward. \r\n It'd be very interesting for everybody to look at the Website, learn about the commission, the makeup of the commission. They list the 27 members of the commission both in the Haitian government as well as the international community. There are non-voting members as well including a representative of the Dominican government. \r\n So that gives you a good feel for what the commission is, what it does, how it operates. In order to facilitate activities also for instance the executive director of the commissioner who hasn't yet been hired, hoping that's going to happen shortly, is able to individually approve projects of $1 million or less. \r\n The two heads or chairs of this commission are former President Bill Clinton and Haiti Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. And Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bellerive they can also approve projects, just the two of them, between $10 million and up to - I believe it's $100 million. We'll look at that slide in a minute. \r\n And then after that it has to be approved by the entire commission which obviously will slow things down somewhat. So the idea is to have the smaller projects approved more rapidly to facilitate that activity. \r\n Now the second organization, of course, of course USAID is pretty well-known to everybody. This Website, the sto.gov is a federal government Website for opportunities and so you have to type in the keyword Haiti to get to the listing of projects relating to Haiti. \r\n There are a number of projects already on there that you can look up. A number of these kinds of projects will probably be won by companies that are most used to dealing with AID and know about the procurement processes and so on. \r\n And as a result there would be a good amount of opportunity for subcontracting. However if you get involved in finding out the details about how the procurement process works you can also qualify and bid and possibly win some of these projects directly. So depending what your company's objectives are, the size of your operations, etcetera, those would be a couple of options. \r\n The third Website is the grants.gov also using the keyword Haiti which will give you information about specific grants coming from different organizations and that also could be helpful in terms of finding out about opportunities. \r\n In terms of a lot of the different projects from World Bank and other organizations including donor countries and the Inter-American Development Bank as well this United Nations site is www.devbusiness.com is a primary site for information on projects. \r\n Now this is a site that you have to subscribe to, it's not free. But once again if somebody is interested and looking for information - detailed information about a lot of the projects that's important especially in terms of subcontracting opportunities. \r\n See the second paragraph here this site also includes the contract awards section so that you can see all the organizations or companies that win each one of the awards that's contracted and get contact information specifics for those companies and organizations. So for subcontracting that would be a very important tool to use to find out information. \r\n Another Website this is Development Gateway Haiti Portal. And this development gateway is an international NGO which coordinates global international aid programs. They've gotten specifically involved in Haiti based on a request by a UN special envoy former President Clinton. And so they're involved as well and you can get information about some of the projects that are involved in. \r\n It's not going to be always - it's everything where you see a lot of bids but to know what's going on and keeping up to date with some of the developments that's going to be an important site. \r\n In addition there will be information that will only be available locally in Haiti. If it's a World Bank and other organizations and NGOs or in many cases (unintelligible) certain amount of the projects only for local companies in Haiti so they will not be advertised outside of Haiti. Some of those projects will only be advertised in places such as newspapers. \r\n Now the newspapers in Haiti of course, the language in Haiti is French and as a result one of the key newspapers is Le Nouvelliste and if you are French-speakers you can read that yourselves and get information or you could look on this other site, the online newspapers where they have some English papers as well for Haiti. \r\n But the best thing really is to establish an in-country contact and that's what we're going to be doing once we get our in-country capacity developed where we can help you establish relationships with Haiti companies and organizations because then if you have a partner in Haiti there'll be a couple of good things that will happen from that. \r\n First of all you will have someone that can be reading the local newspapers and getting the local information about projects that you can bid on through a local company there in Haiti. \r\n And also it's very important to try to have an established Haiti connection; a Haitian company either in Haiti or a member of the Haitian Diaspora in the United States because all these organizations want to make sure the donor countries, the NGOs, the international multi-development banks, etcetera, they want to make sure that Haitian companies and Haitians are going to be involved in this reconstruction process and to make it long-term sustainable. \r\n And as a result having local partners will be a big part of being successful in regards to getting involved in Haiti. Now in terms of financial support for projects we have a number of companies coming to us interested either in establishing a plant in Haiti, for instance in the housing sector, a number of companies want to build modular housing products, etcetera. \r\n Or they want to get involved in real estate development, hotel construction, etcetera. And they're getting involved with Haitian Diaspora groups or companies in Haiti and they need to find sources of financing. There's a number of excellent sources of financing in that regards. \r\n The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is a US government agency that provides loan guarantees, sometimes even direct loans as well as insurance when a project normally has about 25% US equity involved. Now there are some exceptions to that minimum. \r\n But OPEC has a specially in depth interest in getting involved in more projects in Haiti. (Suzanne Echavarria) was one of the participants in our Haiti conference at the Hotel Indigo last June and she did a presentation. And so she would be the right person to contact. \r\n In terms of her presentation from last June there were a number of presentations at the Haiti conference that we co-sponsored with the American Chambers of Commerce from the DR in Haiti. If you go to our Website once a gain at the end of the presentation where it's listed, www.buyusa.gov/Caribbean a lot of the presentations are included from both that even in June and from some of the other Haiti seminars we've done up an down the East Coast over the last four or five months. So please go to that Website also for more details. \r\n The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund is a relatively small fund; right now they only have $50 million but they are constantly obtaining more resources on a daily basis. And they're looking to participate themselves in projects; they don't really give much in the way of grants. They're looking for projects that have some kind of a socioeconomic benefit, creating jobs, training elements, etcetera. \r\n But they're very interested in taking an equity position in interesting projects and it includes things from building hotels to training centers for the apparel industry, etcetera. And so the contact information is there for that organization as well. \r\n International Finance Corporation is another organization that wants to support the private sector development in Haiti. So once again they're not putting out a lot of projects for bid; what they're doing is they want people to come to them that are looking for another financial contributor - or not contribution - another financial component of a financing package for a project. \r\n So if somebody has some other financing in the private sector as well as OPEC, etcetera, they can go to IFC and get more details on what they're interested in. If you go to their Website and click on Haiti you'll also get country-specific information about what they're doing in Haiti. \r\n The Inter-American Development Bank, once again, we'll leave that up to Mac. But that's also an organization you can check out on their Website and get information on Haiti via the link. And we have contacts for both of those organizations as well that are looking for participation from US companies in different projects. \r\n Another thing to keep in mind in regards to doing business in Haiti are the elections coming up on November 28. And this is going to be for the - well 10 senate seats, 99 deputies and the president as well. So in some ways the private sector has become recently a little more reluctant to get involved in investing in big projects because they're a little bit nervous about what's going to happen with the election, this happens in (unintelligible). \r\n So something to keep in mind things are not coming to a halt by any means but when you talk to people in the business community you'll hear them talk about that so it's something to keep in mind. \r\n Now as mentioned before, you know, why does it seem like the process is moving forward so slowly in regard to these projects. And a lot of people complain about that. There's a couple of reasons. First of all, as I mentioned there was not a lot of money yet in the donor fund at the World Bank. \r\n Many countries - there were 50 - have pledged to donate money but very few have actually done it. Even though only about 10% or a little less have done it up to now it is expected that we're going to get a significant more of those resources disbursed in the coming months so that's the good news. \r\n The other thing is the commission, as I mentioned the commission doesn't yet have an executive director, they don't have some of the staff members that are very important for their activities. And as a result it's taken them a while to get that organization up and running. \r\n That organization has to review a number of the projects - many of the projects will be going through the commission before they can be approved then they have to go out for bid. The bids have to be reviewed, etcetera, etcetera so that's a process of several months. \r\n As a result we don't really expect to see a lot of these bigger projects moving forward probably until we get really into 2011 because of the fact it's just going to take some time. There's also real important focus on making sure that this process is open and transparent and that there's not an issue with corruption and some of the other problems we've seen in the past. \r\n And as a result that's - people prefer to be a little slower and make sure that it's done right rather than do it a little too quickly. So those are all reasons why the process sometimes is a little slower than everybody would like to see. \r\n But now things are finally gearing up so that I do expect in the next few months things will fall into place and by early next year I think we'll see a number of these things moving forward. \r\n As I mentioned with some of these Websites I said (unintelligible) and some of the other ones you'll also see things listed at this point that are already moving forward. Some of the NGOs, etcetera, as I mentioned in Haiti and other organizations in Haiti also have had local contracts, World Bank, etcetera. So there are things happening but the larger amount of activity is not going to really move forward until we get these other factors in place. \r\n So to get anymore information feel free to send me an email. My Deputy, (Megan), she'll get (unintelligible) are also working with me on Haiti and you can feel free to send us a note. I'm going to personally be out of town until next Tuesday but if you send an email I will get back to you in a couple of days and feel free to stay in touch with us. \r\n Also another thing if you go to our Website it's as I mentioned with the www.buyusa.gov/Caribbean you can register, if you haven't already done so, on our Haiti interest form. We have over 600 registrants already in our database. \r\n And then as information comes out and we hear about specifics we send out what we call Haiti business bullets and - to everybody on our list so that would give you the chance to stay informed. So we look forward to keeping you up to date, up to speed with what's happening and to supporting your interest in getting involved in the building of a new Haiti. Thank you. \r\n Okay now I think we're going to turn it over to Mac. Thank you Mac. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Hi yes, good afternoon and good morning to all. Can you hear me? \r\n Patrick McRae: Yeah you're coming through Mac. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Okay. What I'm - I'm having trouble, Pat, I can - I have a blank screen as far as the slides. So I'll just start at the top of my presentation and ask you to move it along. Hopefully we're on the same page. I have a hard copy of my presentation so I'm following along what I had given you. \r\n Patrick McRae: Okay we're on Slide 1 of your... \r\n Americo Tadeu: Okay you can go to Outline of Presentation which should be the second one, IDB overview. So for many of you who have not worked with the IDB - and I did take a look of those who are participating and several of you have been through my office or I know of the work that you're already doing in Haiti. Congratulations for a great job that's being done so far. \r\n I wanted to offer a brief background on the IDB and its mission and expanding role particularly what it's doing now in the reconstruction of Haiti which is a first-time effort; they've never done this in the 50-plus years they've been here quite to the extent of what they're doing today in Haiti. \r\n So my intent is to demystify as much as possible the IDB process. It can get confusing and bureaucratic for many of you. And offer some counsel that will help you make a decision as to working with the IDB which parts of the IDB are there for you - for your commercial use. \r\n My core objective here is to ensure that US companies - that's why we have an office in the bank here to give a fair opportunity to US businesses in relationship with their activities here at the bank. \r\n Next slide. We have an overview of the IDB. It was founded over 50 years ago and is the largest single source of multilateral lending to Latin America and the Caribbean. While the IDB shares many similarities with other credit institutions some of which are quite active in the region or homegrown in the particular countries such as many commercial banks the IDB is also unique in some other respects. \r\n When it makes a loan it does expect it to be repaid. It is - does try to make a profit because it reinvests those profits back into the region. But the core objective is not a high return on the capital but rather to promote the economic and social development of the 20-some odd borrowing countries. \r\n Besides loans it's good to know that the bank provides grants, technical assistance, cooperative research and cooperative efforts with other ministries as well as private association groups in the country. \r\n The US government's participation in the IDB is based on the core principal that economic and social development of the region will lead to greater security and stability and investment and prosperity which is good not only for all those people living in Latin America and the Caribbean but also important for us here in the US. \r\n Next slide. As far as the division of capital shares and voting power you see the pie there. There are 48 total member countries of which 26 are borrowers. The voting power of each member country of the bank is based on a shareholding in the IDB's ordinaire capital which means exactly what dollars or currency they're investing in the pool. \r\n The US is by far the largest shareholder. We have slightly more than 30% of the voting power so we hold the quorum for any meeting. The 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries have 50.2% in theory being that this bank belongs to its borrowers; to the Latin American and Caribbean countries. \r\n Next slide. The lending history and what it's able to do, the IDB is a AAA rated credit rated institution. It allows it to borrow cheaply and lend at competitive rates in many places where the private sector is unwilling to lend because of the perceived risk. \r\n At the bank's annual conference this year in April the Board of Governors of the bank agreed in principal to increase the bank's capital in order to double the lending capacity while still maintaining its outstanding rating. So they're looking to historically move from lending $6-$7 billion a year to a minimum of $12 billion a year. \r\n Last year you'll see that the bank invested $15.6 billion. That was basically an infusion of some temporary capital in order to address the global financial crisis and make up for the gap from the private sector. \r\n Next slide. It's priorities, in order to achieve a greater impact on development in Latin America and the Caribbean the IDB has identified these key areas for you to work with. They launch new initiatives aimed at merging challenges that face the region. \r\n The IDB partners with countries try to combat poverty and promote social equity through its programs tailored to the local conditions. That's important here, it's not about transferring technology as its used in developed economies but what fits and works best in developing - in developing economies. \r\n Working with governments as well as the private sector the bank seeks to achieve sustainable economic growth, increased competitiveness among groups there, modernize public institutions so that they can regulate and offer reliable oversight of industries and sectors and foster free trade and regional integration which is good for everyone. \r\n Next slide, Pat, please. Overview of the project distribution, this gives you an idea of the programming and how it's spread among a wide range of industries and development activities from investments in infrastructure projects like roads and highways to less visible but critical projects that promote the modernization of the government, for example, judicial reform or other type of health policy, education policy reform. \r\n So now let's drill down to Haiti specifically, next slide. And its role here is to be a major payer in the reconstruction and redevelopment of Haiti. The IDB has for many years been lending and the key lending source, more than the World Bank, for long term financing. \r\n About 40% of the financing is in infrastructure projects, 20% in agriculture and the environment, 25% in basic services and 15% in governance and institutional capacity building to strengthen the Haitian public sector. \r\n Since the earthquake the IDB shareholders have agreed to provide $479 million to cover the cost of completely eliminating Haiti's debt to the IDB. As part of this process $323 million will be made available for grants for direct assistance to the country. \r\n In addition the IDB shareholders have agreed to provide another $2.2 billion in grants to Haiti over the next 11 years so you're looking at about $20 million a year. So this year the bank is busy looking at about $400 million over the next 12 months. \r\n And these are again extra money that's used by freeing up what debt reduction efforts that they've made to use toward direct grants. The IDB established a Haiti response group, first time ever in the history of the bank, is headed by (Augustina Gery) who's been in and out of the region since the earthquake. He's based here at headquarters here in Washington. \r\n To work with the government of Haiti and the Haiti reconstruction and development agency that Bob mentioned to develop the proposals from the bank and what its interests are according to the post-disaster needs assessment plan which the IDB developed with the government of Haiti. And to complement what other agencies as well as private sector groups are looking to do. \r\n Some of the key areas we're looking at are housing, transportation, water, education, disaster prevention, private sector and budget support for the government. \r\n Next slide. IDB commitments, the IDB is also looking at cash for work programs, agricultural assistance and reforestation projects. Much of the work that would be happening before the earthquake to support Haiti's efforts to foster again the - concentrating on economic development above and beyond what happened to Port-au-Prince and those cities that were hit by the earthquake. \r\n And a bit to help the Haitian private sector boost economic activity and job creation it is also looking to promote local and foreign investment in new industrial parks. They're working with consortium groups on that. And textile manufacturing plants to bring them up and running as well as expanding the current services that were available. \r\n The Multilateral Investment Fund, it's the MIF, and the International - the Inter-American Investment Corporation, the IIC, are part of the IDB bank group and working at a more private sector level offering financial system assistance. \r\n The MIF, the Multilateral Investment Fund, is particularly active in ensuring that micro-finance institutions are available, they're still making loans to their clients and distributing remittances especially in the countryside which after the earthquake a lot of people left the principal city and have gone to the countryside or their former hometowns and many services are needed there as much as in Port-au-Prince. \r\n Next slide, the Haiti Response Group mentioned who's the head of it now, how they're setting themselves up. They work with a very active team in Haiti through the country representative in (Guarde La Meda) and a fairly large staff. \r\n My office, both (Barbara White) and I meet regularly with these teams - with the people coming to and from as far as what bank projects are coming onboard. I'm going to give you the Website, iadb.org, that's www.iadb.org to find out the country Web link and where you can find that information. \r\n We've been working regularly with US companies and other third-country firms to partner as much as possible so that's part of my counsel to you in addition to what Bob's talking about aside from working with local firms and individuals trying to partner and build the team not only from the United States but oftentimes a complimentary consultation and equipment as well as other services can be found through Canadian groups as well as the French who work quite closely with a lot of US firms in-country already. \r\n Next slide, identifying business opportunities for you. So there's that Website I mentioned. In the case of procurement opportunities you can get started right there. The procurement page provides information on how to pursue business opportunities throughout the bank. \r\n So in this case you'll see a large icon that takes you direct to the Haiti group and where the projects are. The great news here is that you can sign up for electronic alerts that provide timely information on the categories, the countries and the sectors that are of interest to you. This is a simple three-step process you can follow. You can select and customize your search and it comes straight to your work or email box. \r\n Let's take a look at some samples, next slide. These are some of the projects that the IDB has in process. These are - this is just a small cadre of a large set of projects that keep on coming on board. Many of them are still in the preparation stage so many of the players involved with this - these project proposals are looking for more input, looking at new systems of how to and possible ways of doing things the best way possible for the country. \r\n Note that these projects aren't all in Port-au-Prince. As I mentioned earlier they're scattered among the principal cities and agricultural sectors of the country. They're running - and the ID projects are running concurrently and not always through that main executive agency that Bob mentioned. \r\n So the larger projects are working complementary with the executive committee making sure that there's as much of efficiency of scale and doubling of efforts where monies can be used in other areas. So the bank is in constant contact but looking at this Website will give you a clear idea of what the IDB is doing on its own and independently in many respects. \r\n Next slide, project listings. This is the type of information that's going to tell you everything you're going to need, the project description, the status of it, who are the different players, what type of financial information is important. Is it provided in a grant, equity loan, loan guarantees? Who are the principal players both in the IDB as well as the local - what I mean by executing agency - the local ministry in Haiti or entity that's on the ground that will be running the project. \r\n It provides PDF files of all the relevant documents you need. Some of it you'll see initially in French. If it is appearing first in French you will then - a week or so afterwards usually see English and/or Spanish copies of all the documents. Many of them do appear originally in English and remain in English also. \r\n Next one. Business strategy for success. Following along the lines of what Bob told you already it's about building your strategic team, reaching out to our office, Bob's office down there as well as the US embassy there as well as the IDB offices in Haiti. They have a specialized team working - covering most of the industries that Bob mentioned and certainly all of the ones that I talked about in my presentation. \r\n It's important to do due diligence when you're working in any foreign market. Our offices can also help you with that or working through other entities that can provide that information for you. If we don't have the information we'll refer you to the right person. \r\n Again most important build those relationships with both public and private sector officials. Keep in mind elections are coming up, some of the players will be changing and so you need to be very strategic in how you're approaching Haiti. \r\n Last one, there's our contact information both myself as well as (Barbara White). We're here to assist you and look forward to receiving your emails as well as telephone calls. Thank you. Hello? \r\n Patrick McRae: Hey, thank you Mac. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Okay. \r\n Patrick McRae: With that I think we can proceed to the question and answer session. I think the Operator will come on to assist us with that. \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. At this time if you would like to ask a question please press star 1, please record your first and last name when prompted. To withdraw your request press star 2. Once again to ask a question please press star 1. One moment please. \r\n Terri Batch: Just a real quick question while we're waiting for others to chime in, Mac, would the IDB offer private loans to individuals or businesses? \r\n Americo Tadeu: Not directly. What is important is to know that there's a local partner involved that - think again in economic develop terms. The bank's principal purpose is to know that whatever loans or projects or feasibility studies is going to be benefiting directly local partners. \r\n Much of that is once you have a local partner having them work with the IDB for that loan assistance or grant assistance. When it goes directly to a US entity or interested party it's oftentimes with pilot projects. \r\n But again oftentimes looking for who will your local partner be, what type of job capacity or capacity building will be made available through this project rather than just assisting like in the (XM) bank side just helping in working capital loans for US firms to export abroad. Think in terms of economic development and the local players. \r\n Coordinator: Your first question comes from (Bruce Johnson), your line is open. \r\n (Bruce Johnson): Yes. Do we get a copy of the PowerPoint for all these Websites and addresses and names? \r\n Patrick McRae: Terri, can you respond to that? \r\n Terri Batch: Yes I'll send you a follow up email with a link to the recording and also with the PowerPoints that have been included in today's presentation. \r\n (Bruce Johnson): Thank you. \r\n Terri Batch: I have another question while we're waiting for the next person. We mentioned a lot of NGOs. So far you guys have mentioned a lot of NGOs or funds looking for investors. Is there a private industry beginning to do rebuild projects or particularly local businesses? And how can they get that contact information? \r\n Bob Jones: If I could address that, there is a private sector. The private sector before the earthquake wasn't even large and it also obviously was somewhat decimated like the rest of the country by the earthquake. However that being said there are a number of key businesses that are certainly looking for partners. There's a real desire also to try to facilitate the development of small business and training of Haitians as well. \r\n And in terms of facilitating those kinds of relationships and contacts unfortunately we can't do that today once again because we don't have an (unintelligible) capability. And we will let people know as soon as we're able to have that capability which we hope will happen by sometime in September and then we can try to help set up some more programs such as meetings and so on, key lists, that type of thing and working also with the key chambers. \r\n There's an American Chamber of Commerce in Haiti which is also a good point of contact. There's also a Chamber of Commerce of Haiti. So there are a number of business organizations but the other thing to also remember is the Haitian Diaspora. \r\n Now the Department of Commerce organized several seminars directed to the Haitian Diaspora for the most part in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Miami over the last few months. And there are a number of organizations some of them are investor groups of Haitian Diaspora that are getting involved in projects. \r\n For instance one is (Jacquemel) in Southern Haiti is a real estate hotel agriculture project and that is basically from money - from medical professionals all members of the Haitian Diaspora in the New York City area and they're investing money in that project. \r\n So you can link up with the Haitians that have contacts in Haiti that are based in the US as well as Haitian companies that are based in Haiti. We will look forward to helping you to develop those contacts because that is an important part of being successful. \r\n Coordinator: Your next question comes from (Collin Ward), your line is open. \r\n (Collin Ward): Good afternoon gentlemen and thanks for having me on the call. I'm specifically interested in technology; I represent a technology company that deploys solutions globally. And I was wondering whether or not you could provide some commentary on (IFCT) in education in Haiti and what projects or programs are underway right now to bring some technologies to the schools that as they are built? \r\n ((Crosstalk)) \r\n Bob Jones: I'm sorry, go ahead. \r\n Americo Tadeu: If I could just stress just because specifically about a month or so ago the IDB signed an MOU with the government of Haiti for an entire revamp of - and the study of the education process. As you know most children were in some sort of private form of education in which tuition was being paid by the families. \r\n These are oftentimes disposable income used towards education which could otherwise be used to help the family in other areas such as healthcare and building lives as well as expanding and improving their home and work situation. \r\n The IDB is very committed to looking at setting up an entire nationwide system in which there can be an overview from the public sector, in case the Ministry of Education, and then utilizing all the private sector healthcare - I'm sorry, private sector education providers in the country since there is expertise there raising standards, providing nationwide certification so that schools in one area are providing the same public education as in another, something that will have a long term affect for generations to come. \r\n So check on the Website, there's quite a bit of information there. \r\n Bob Jones: Following up on Mac's comments the important thing to remember that this is a huge project on a national scale. This is not the kind of thing where there are individual projects happening for the most part. And so it's - that's once again the reason the reason it's a little bit slow. \r\n But you have to realize they're basically trying to implement this action plan for national reconstruction and development, as I mentioned you can find on a couple of those Websites, which include six regional development centers around the country where they want to distribute the population. \r\n Most of these really don't have any infrastructure or population base today so they have to basically build new cities for all practical purposes. They have plans to build 30 new hospitals, hundreds of new schools, 600 kilometers of new roads. \r\n So once again this activity is going to be part of all these large projects that have to go before this commission and be approved. There'll be primary contractors and then there'll be a tremendous amount of subcontracting. So in terms of ITT equipment of course there will be significant opportunities but not so much in the short term, it's going to be medium and long term. \r\n Now there is a ITT association in Haiti and the current president of that association is the newest, youngest member on the Board of Directors at AmCham, the American Chamber of Commerce in Haiti. If you shoot me an email I'd be glad to give you his contact information and I would recommend him as an initial contact and he can sort of tie you into some of those activities. \r\n But this is something - once again we have to remember the scale of this activity. This is something that is going to be so huge and it's so complex that it's not something going ahead piece by piece. A lot of companies come to us and they're sure that somebody else - one of their competitors is already getting all these contracts and the truth is these contracts haven't been given out yet because contracts haven't been awarded because of all these other processes, forming the commission and having the money actually disbursed to the fund, etcetera, etcetera. \r\n The Haitian government in many ways will be decision makers on some of these projects, for instance some of the World Bank and other projects. However most of the projects will have to go through the commission process, the review process. And so it's going to be something that's going to take time. \r\n There's going to be a lot of opportunities; for people that are willing to take the longer term outlook and be patient there will be very significant opportunities. \r\n Patrick McRae: Bob and Mac, we've received a couple of related questions, maybe I'll insert those here. For the construction firms do you know if there were previously or are there now sources of information such as topographical maps, boundary surveys, soil quality maps, you know, wind charts, that sort of things that relate to the actual practical aspects of construction? You know if there is or was a source of that sort of information nationally? \r\n Bob Jones: No basically - not in any depth. And also once again we're talking about the six regional population centers. These are areas that have had no significant populations in the past so there will be - that process will have to go forward - all that type of work will have to be done, the groundwork, before they can build the cities. \r\n We're talking about housing, schools, hospitals, sewage systems, energy plants, roads. It all has to be interconnected. So it's part of this master plan. The trick is to getting it down to the implementation stage. So there is not a lot of information like that available in the short term; that's going to be part of this process and there's going to be a great need for the services to obtain that information. \r\n Americo Tadeu: On the bank - on the part of the IDB you'll be seeing projects come along in which consulting services in the - in the area of environmental studies as well as feasibility studies coming from the bank. So US services and consultancy expertise will be needed there too so watch for that. \r\n Coordinator: Your next question comes from (Laura Ma Jean Pierre), your line is open. \r\n (Laura Ma Jean Pierre): Hi. My question is about IDB. It has been mentioned that IDB is one of the - the institutions that's available to sponsor certain organization. I would like to know is IDB sponsoring a project to a private firm or individual? Will there be any help, for example, if somebody lose their business and stuff like that or if small startup company they want to get involved would IDB be a sponsor or is IDB only for government? \r\n Americo Tadeu: No it's for private as well. Most of the monies are used towards larger projects that are for - that involve public sector or a public private partnership which will be seen coming down the pike also. When I mentioned the multilateral investment fund and the Inter-American Investment Corporation that's where they're getting into more small grants and micro-lending to individuals in Haiti. \r\n (Laura Ma Jean Pierre): Where I can send for information on the Website about that? \r\n Americo Tadeu: On the Website I mentioned www.iadb.org and type in - and you'll see a link for the MIF, M-I-F, or the IIC, all that information is there. \r\n (Laura Ma Jean Pierre): Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: Your next question comes from (Mike Connier), your line is open. \r\n (Mike Connier): Thank you. Mac, can you speak to the regulatory or government oversight environment as it relates to design and construction professionals working in Haiti? \r\n Americo Tadeu: As far as specific outlines as far as work permits and things like that? \r\n (Mike Connier): Well both the licensure of professionals and then permitting and those type of things that are - that we sort of take for granted here in the States. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Okay. \r\n Patrick McRae: Building codes, that sort of thing. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Oh well as far as building codes and such much of that is probably in flux. I'm going to defer to Bob because in the case of the - anything that's tied to the bank and bank loans that is oftentimes handled because you're being hired by a government entity. \r\n But as far as someone else looking to start a business there, Bob, as far as the AmCham being the best resource or... \r\n Bob Jones: Yeah, well in terms of building standards and codes part of the problem is they haven't had them - the ones they had were not enforced and you can see what happened as a result of that earthquake. So they are in the process of developing those. They want to make sure that when these new construction projects go forward that they have international standards and codes that will be in effect and will be, you know, enforced. \r\n So that is not something that's developed now, that's part of the process that they're doing at this point. In terms of certification licensing that is something that's in disarray at this point not just for construction but for other industries as well. \r\n It wasn't very well developed or enforced before the earthquake much less afterwards, you know. Every single government ministry had significant or total damage from the earthquake except for one. Seventeen percent of the federal workforce of the country died in the earthquake. So these are all things that have complicated the procedures to try to move forward in some of those areas. \r\n There's not a lot of things on the ground now. Once again, yes, AmCham would certainly be a point of contact to start with but it's not an area that is yet developed to the point it needs to be. And the international community and the Haitian government are both very interested in making sure that there are the right standards and codes that are developed and also enforced in regards to a lot of this new construction. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Another thing that's occurred along the way thought it wasn't well designed or maintained before the earthquake but as far as tracking people, social services, unemployment benefits, healthcare benefits and then as far as slowing down the issues as far as development you're looking at titles to land, who owns the property. \r\n So that's been quite a challenge here for people at the bank or anybody looking at manufacturing facilities, setting up centers either just for light manufacturing or setting up these clusters, economic clusters and land for residential living or even agricultural use has been a challenge. \r\n Bob Jones: That's a good point, Mac. Yes that's a terrible problem right now because so many of the records were destroyed in the earthquake. The records weren't even complete before but since the earthquake it's much worse so that is a big issue. \r\n It's also important to remember because of all these kinds of issues that we're talking about, I mean, before the earthquake Haiti had about 38% illiteracy; only 10% of the population had access to electricity; that was before the earthquake. So those things have gotten even worse. \r\n My point is it's a difficult environment to do business in which is one of the reasons you want to have a local partner. It's also important to realize it's going to take more time to do things. Right now the US embassy has a policy where visitors or embassy employees or US government visitors can only stay in hotel rooms that have been certified to be solid by the security office of the embassy. In the entire city of Port-au-Prince there's only 100 hotel rooms that they've approved of. \r\n We have a lot of visitors that go to Port-au-Prince and go to - have meetings there that are staying in tents at the US embassy still today. Now that's getting better, the (Caribe) Hotel is supposed to open up again in October. We'll see some improvements and other new hotel projects are moving forward. \r\n But it is important to realize that it's not like flying into Mexico City, Buenos Aires, or Santo Domingo. When you go to do business it's going to take more time and you have to allow that and factor that in when you're looking at doing things. Once again it's a business environment and also can be complicated, it also has tremendous opportunities because there is such a need for so many different products and services. \r\n And so if you're patient take a medium to longer term outlook there will be significant opportunities for many industries and sectors, construction obviously one of the primary ones. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Think in terms also of just getting around the country just by car, four by four, the necessity there or roads that were unused before no longer being used or just the travel times from place to place. \r\n Bob Jones: Exactly. For instance we had a couple of meetings recently in Port-au-Prince, in another city I would have had five or six meetings in a day; we had two meetings because it took us two hours just to drive back and forth to each meeting; that was four hours so half the day was just driving to the two meetings. \r\n You add in the meeting time itself and a quick lunch and that was the whole day. So it is very difficult because of the lack of good infrastructure but there are very ambitious plans to put in a lot of new infrastructure in terms of roads and other areas as well. So hopefully those things will be improving significantly in the coming months and years. \r\n Patrick McRae: We have another question by text. Will import duties be waived and if so for how long? \r\n Bob Jones: That's a good question. Mac, if you don't mind if I... \r\n Americo Tadeu: Please. \r\n Bob Jones: ...address that one. This has been a big problem because a lot of the aid organizations also, the donor organizations that are sending in donations are getting taxed. But at this point the Haitian government has said they need to have the revenues; they have not offered any waivers for import duties. \r\n I know that that's being discussed. Former President Clinton was also discussing that with the Haitian government. I think that's something that might change in the future but at this point everybody is being charged full custom duties whether they say it's donated or not. \r\n The Haitian government says well they don't have the resources to prove that actually once it's in the country it's not being sold. So at this point duties are not being waived but that might change at least for some products in the future. \r\n Terri Batch: Excuse me, it is now four minutes after the hour and our hour-long time for the Webinar has passed. If you guys want - can stay on the line for another say 5 or 10 minutes to answer more questions please do but if people have to get off we want to respect your time. This is being recorded and you can access it at another time. \r\n Mac and Bob can you guys answer more questions or do you need to get off now as well? \r\n Americo Tadeu: I have... \r\n Bob Jones: No, no... \r\n Americo Tadeu: ...time for another five minutes. \r\n Bob Jones: Yeah, I do to. \r\n Terri Batch: Okay let's do five minutes and... \r\n Bob Jones: Okay. \r\n Terri Batch: ...we have some that have been typed. Pat do you want to read some of those... \r\n Patrick McRae: Yeah. \r\n Terri Batch: ...questions that have been typed? \r\n Patrick McRae: Yeah. There's one here, what can you - Bob, this might be a good one for you. What can you describe that is being done to address or limit the corruption factor that has previously, you know, existed or that Haiti is known for? \r\n Bob Jones: Exactly. Well just a couple of things, first of all the fiduciary fund that's been set up at the World Bank is being supervised and managed by the World Bank. And for funding to come out of that fund for any projects it has to be projects that have been approved and reviewed and are being monitored and supervised by the commission, the Interim Haiti Reconstruction Commission. \r\n There's also an international accounting firm being used as well in that regard. And transparency and openness is a priority for everybody. I mean, we're talking to the same people we say, you know, IDD, same thing with World Bank, UN and even though sometimes it makes the process slower it's something that's very important to everybody concerned. \r\n The Haitian government is not receiving a lot of the funds and then able to do things on its own; it has to do things in cohort with the international community. Now there are some funds that have gone to fill their budget gaps for this year because they have a fairly significant budget deficit and they had more control of those funds, I think about $130 million or so. \r\n But in general in terms of the billions of dollars we're hearing about most of that will not be totally controlled by the Haitian government it will be monies that are utilized (unintelligible) international community support and oversight as well. \r\n Patrick McRae: Okay thank you. Mac, perhaps for you, what is the breakdown between IDB loan versus grants? And what is the determining factor for providing a loan versus a grant for a project? \r\n Americo Tadeu: Okay with regard to a loan just like you would for your commercial bank they are lending to you the money, they are offering you the capital. And there's an agreed interest rate and cost and payment terms involved. \r\n As far as a grant certainly much smaller amounts compared to what an IDB loan can be hundreds of millions of dollars. A grant usually in the case of the multilateral investment fund no more than $10 million. \r\n Grants are oftentimes used in the case of startup industries looking to enhance an industry that may already be in country but looking to improve their competiveness at another component to it. So a grant would be available to, again, either a private sector or public sector entity and there's no payment terms for that. \r\n Patrick McRae: Thank you. \r\n Terri Batch: And do you want to check with the operator just to see if there's anyone waiting to ask a question? \r\n Patrick McRae: Yes, Operator if you're listening do we have a phone-in question ready? \r\n Coordinator: Yes sir, your next question comes from (Richard Barbor), your line is open. \r\n (Richard Barbor): Hi this is (Rich Barbor). Actually my question was answered earlier. I just wanted to know where you can get a copy of the presentation. \r\n Terri Batch: Okay... \r\n Patrick McRae: Those will be forthcoming to the registrants, correct Terri? \r\n Terri Batch: Yes it will be. Next question - we've got two minutes. \r\n Coordinator: The next question comes from (Jude Avril), your line is open. \r\n (Jude Avril): Thank you for taking my call. My question is there are representatives that you guys have in Haiti how do we make sure that our business partners over there are not going to be treated, you know, like (unintelligible) business as usual where we can expect more sort of an American way of doing business? \r\n Americo Tadeu: Bob? \r\n Bob Jones: Well that's an interesting question. There's not really any way of guaranteeing any type of culture in terms of doing business. Now we will have a person, a contractor, based there who will help with contacts and information lists and some appointments. But they'll be working there within the local business community. \r\n It is very important to try to get information certainly about potential business partners; you want to know who you're dealing with. And that's harder to obtain that information in Haiti than it is in many other countries. So it is a challenge. \r\n But through contacts at the economic section at the embassy and the key chambers and so on we would be able to try to help you identify organizations to get some background information. We have a service where we try to do some background information checks. And so we can help with some of our Commercial Service programs. \r\n And those of you who don't know about our programs once again get in touch with your local US export assistance center; we have over 100 around the country. We are required to charge for our services by the Office of Management and Budget but certainly reasonable fees. But we will be more than happy to try to help you and assist US companies with some of these programs once we have somebody on the ground. \r\n It won't be like a full office of course operating there. I mean, in Santo Domingo we have 10 people here and we get backed up. So with one person it's going to be - it'll be a little bit overwhelming initially. But we will certainly try to help you identify the right people and then get you information that's available on who those people are as well. \r\n Patrick McRae: There are a number of questions remaining I'm sure but unfortunately I think we've run out of time. I did replace the slide with the contact information for Bob Jones' team down in the Dominican Republic. A question to him or to Mac can be forwarded from there to any relevant office or specialist so I would invite everyone to submit their questions perhaps via email and we'll try to get to you all as soon as we can. \r\n Terri any final words? \r\n Terri Batch: No they can also send questions to me, terri - T-E-R-R-I .batch - B-A-T-C-H @trade.gov and I will forward them on to either to Bob and his team or to Mac at the IDB. So we're sorry we couldn't get to everyone but we will let - try our best to answer your questions after the call. \r\n Patrick McRae: Thank you. \r\n Terri Batch: All right thank you everyone. \r\n Bob Jones: Thank you. \r\n Americo Tadeu: Good day. \r\n Bob Jones: Take care. Bye-bye. \r\n Coordinator: This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for attending. You may disconnect at this time. \r\n END \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-14","title":"NMEI: Reconstruction in Haiti","update_date":"2013-05-15","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Haiti"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"494","content":" September 23, 2009 \r\n Wind, Solar, Hydro, Bio Fuels, Energy Efficiency, Waste to Energy: Experts from China, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand will provide specific market intelligence on the areas that have the greatest opportunity in these markets. \r\n \r\n Download the full video (188 Mb) \r\n Transcript \r\n RENEWABLE ENERGY OPPORTUNITIES IN ASIA \r\n   \r\n MODERATOR: \r\n JEFF HAMILTON (SP), \r\n U.S. COMMERCIAL SERVICE \r\n   \r\n SPEAKERS: \r\n DR.

I’m with the Commercial Service office based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Many of you are currently Commercial Service clients, and some of you are new to the Commercial Service. \r\n Real briefly, the Commercial Service has offices throughout the United States and throughout the world, and our organization helps U.S. companies to sell their products and services overseas through a number of different manners. So any questions you may have regarding exporting, please feel free to let me know. You should have my contact information, and I can direct you to the right person. \r\n Today – apologies for our difficulties with the webinar last week. And so today we are doing a recording of the webinar. And due to coordinating different schedules, our Singapore speaker is unavailable, but we will have speakers from China, from Thailand, and, I believe, from Taiwan as well. \r\n So our first speaker is Greg Harris, who is a commercial counselor at the Commercial Service office in Shanghai. And Greg has a wealth of experience in Asia, in China and in Taiwan. And he will speak, along with a couple of commercial specialists from our office in Shanghai, Scott Yao and Lisa Tang, on alternative-energy opportunities in the – in the China market. \r\n Greg, welcome. Thank you very much for joining us, and please proceed with your presentation. \r\n GREG HARRIS: Thank you, Jeff. \r\n Distinguished guests, I would like to welcome you to China, so to speak. China’s hot and getting hotter. I mean that literally and figuratively. China’s a big market. A lot of people are talking about it. And literally, it is getting hotter. It’s a lot of coal, which we’ll talk about in just a minute, and it’s a good place to discuss alternative energy. \r\n Our focus of our presentation today will be to talk about what are the opportunities for you. Some of the numbers are big, but what would the numbers be for you? \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n We can always start with a few amazing numbers and statistics about China. The one thing we’ll need to think about what’s going to happen in China is the mass urbanization that has already occurred over the last 30 years and will occur in the next 30 years. By some estimates, we’ve still got several hundred million people that are still going to move to cities in the coming years. They’re going to want power; they’re going to want lights; they’re going to want cars; they’re going to want all the modern-day conveniences of urban life. \r\n And to do that, we’re going to see lots of construction. Half the world’s construction in the next – or the first 30 years of this century may take place in China. These are some of the anecdotes, urban legends, what have you. But this is what they’re saying here. Half the world’s buildings constructed over the next 10 years, things like this. One of the most amazing statistics I’ve heard is there’s more floor space already in China than the U.S. and the EU combined. \r\n I did want to segue into just a little bit of an offshoot, and that is green building and retrofitting. Because these green buildings will be already built or be in construction in the very near future, a lot of them will use current technologies. So if there’s people in – (audio break) – people in the green building sector, that may be the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency. Retrofitting current buildings may be a way to reduce the need for some of the current based energy technologies. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: And just – I’m sorry to jump in, Greg. I just want to make sure you’re able to see the slides flipping? Yes? \r\n MR. HARRIS: Yes. Yes, I can see the slides. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: That’s great. \r\n MR. HARRIS: I hope the audience can too. \r\n And my next one is some general advice that I would like to give to everyone. On the previous slide, I talked – there – I didn’t mention it, but I’ll mention it now. China in some ways is cheap. But it’s very expensive to do business here in some ways. \r\n And what I mean by that is, when you come here it’s a very competitive market. It’s very cost-and quality-conscious in what they want to purchase. So I think you should really try to do things right. Over the years I’ve learned to really count on using professional support. I don’t think you should have any napkin business plans coming into China. I think you should have professional programs with professional support: lawyers, accountants, consultants. Do your own professional due diligence, do your own due diligence, have a really – (audio break) – plan and a really good theme on China to do your market-entry plan. \r\n In IPR, there’s two schools of thought, basically. One is you just got to come here and do things, try, and don’t worry so much about the IPR. The other is, if you feel that the market is ready for you, then you should take all the precautions you can. I’m even more conservative than that. I say that you should take your precautions now. China’s a first-to-file country. If you have a – (inaudible) – (audio break) – leading technologies, I would get them patented and trademarked and such as soon as possible. Again, that goes back to a professional plan. \r\n There are disputes in China, and the percentage may be low, but they seem to be quite big and quite – I don’t want to say vicious, but they’re – can be quite confrontational and – compared to the other places in Asia I’ve been. And so I would encourage you to have a plan to exit and to not over-rely on the people who say, “I have guanxi,” which is, I have a relationship with somebody. Because people leave, people move, people change positions. Government policies and emphasis change. And if you’re all depending on one person knowing somebody, it may not suit you the best, or it may not be your best avenue. \r\n Okay, a little bit back to energy. Next slide, please. \r\n Okay. What are we talking about right now? Right now, three-fourths of China’s energy comes from coal. We just wanted to just have the conversation right now, and let’s just do with what we have now. It would be a – I would encourage anybody, any geniuses out there, to find a quick and painless technology to work on clean or cleaner coal. I know there’s some technologies out there and they’re trying them, but still, the elephant in the room is coal. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n In the year 2020, this is what China predicts – or the statistics predict it will look like. Coal is still predominant. And with a rising and growing base of energy use in China, there will still be a lot of coal, a lot more than now, so that one should remember that. But also look at the growth of the alternative energies. China’s stimulus and policies are looking for some big additions to the energy mix or makeup in the year 2020. \r\n Now I’d like to introduce Scott Yao. Could we have the next slide, please? \r\n SCOTT YAO: Thank you, Greg. Hello. \r\n MR. HARRIS: Scott is our commercial specialist who covers conventional, nuclear and wind energy. And he’ll brief you a little bit on what he sees in the wind-energy market. \r\n MR. YAO: Yeah, thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone. Just let me (stand ?) with you a minute to go through the wind energy and, later on, the oil energy. \r\n As you know, China is one of the largest country in the world in terms of the geographic area. So here we have abundant resource of wind power. According to Chinese authorities’ assessment made a couple years ago, we have, total, about 3,226 gigawatts of the wind-power resource. And amount of this of 1,000 gigawatts could be commercialized. So based on this assessment, the wind power is very likely to become the third-largest resource of energy in China, so just right after thermal and hydro power. \r\n In 2006, Chinese government issued a renewable-energies law to advance China (push broad ?) commercialization of wind-power industry. Chinese wind-power capacity has been growing (rapidly ?) there, and starting from 2.6 gigawatts in 2006 to 12 gigawatts in 2008. \r\n So in the meantime, the manufacturing of localization of wind industry has been speeding up as well. As you can see, 50 percent of newly installed wind turbines were locally made in 2007. And it reached about 74 percent in 2008. \r\n However, you know, because the development of a national graph lagged behind the wind-power industry, its demand, so it’s only about 70 percent of wind power was connected at rate. So that’s a (positive net ?) for the wind-power industry in China. \r\n Although, you know – (inaudible) – there’s also some opportunity for the key components and the technologies for – (inaudible) – later on. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Here I’ll just give you some of the figures to remind you of the two major facts. One, the imports of the wind turbines is going down very quickly, and (opening wide ?) the export of the wind turbine increasingly – increased also sharply. \r\n The other fact is, you can see the wind turbine imported, the value of that is very huge. The exports – unit of the exports – the unit price of the exports is very low. So that means China imports a high-value and big-capacity wind turbine, and – but exports the wind turbine which is very low-end and a small capacity. \r\n And since 2008, Chinese government just changed a little on the current policy for imports. You can see here. Any wind turbine below 2.5 (gigawatts) will not enjoy the tax (privilege ?) policy. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Here I want to highlight for you that China, we have – in China we have big five power producer, which is Hua Nung (ph), Tha Song (ph), Hua Tieng (ph), Guo Dien (ph), CPI (ph). So this is a top five power producers in China. Their total power capacity accounted for about 44 percent of the national total capacity. \r\n So here you can see for the – for each of them, the wind power capacity just kind of very, very small percent of their total capacity. And China’s government already announced their policy for each of these – for each of the power producers which is over 5 gigawatts, for them, they have to increase its ownership of power generation from 900 renewable energy – (inaudible, foreground noise) – to be 3 percent by 2010 and – by – and 8 percent by 2020. So you can see there is a huge gap for each power producer to fill in the future for the wind power. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Yeah, I also want to highlight for you that we have now seven wind-power-based projects, we call “wind power Three Gorges” project. Each wind-power base is capacity over 10 gigawatts. So to reach the goal of 2020, 1 gigawatt, Chinese government just set this long-term plan to construct a large – seven large-scale wind-power bases in Hebei, Gansu, Xinjiang, Jilin – (inaudible) – and Inner Mongolia. \r\n Among these seven, the target in Gansu is currently under construction. And the other one I would highlight for you, that in Shanghai we have offshore wind farm, which is the first one, I think, in Asia. \r\n Next, please. \r\n What is the opportunity for the U.S. company? As I mentioned earlier, although the localization is speeding up, but still there are a lot of opportunities for U.S. companies. As you might know, in China we have currently about 80 wind-turbine manufacturers in China. So about 90 percent of them rely on import technologies. So they don’t have efficient capability to develop research on their own. So that means they also looking for some new technology and their new products. Here, the area they are looking for, like, wind turbines systems design, security policy design, (variance/bearings ?), remotoring, et cetera. \r\n And also, the technology force not great. \r\n However, there are also some challenges. I just want to highlight two. First is a local-content requirement. Any projects developed in China, there has to be a 70 percent local content. So that’s a challenge for U.S. or any foreign company. And also the challenge is any project under a similar package should be a domestic product. \r\n Okay, so now, just let’s go through the bio-energy. \r\n Next. \r\n Same as the wind power, China also has a bio-energy resource, bioresources, which is very diversified in – widely across the China. Here just are some figures according to the Chinese government that is – next, please. \r\n So you can see, based on the government (cancellations ?), the targets for bioenergy outputs will increase very substantially between 2010 and 2020. Here I just want to remind you, China’s government banned food – banned the food-based feedstock for the use of the biofuel in 2007, starting promoting the non-food-based feedstock. So that’s the policy change. \r\n Mostly, I just want to highlight for – some opportunities for the foreign companies. \r\n Next, please. \r\n As I mentioned, it looks like they have to be speeded up. But still China is immature, and there’s – (inaudible) – lack some regulation for the biofuel industry. And also, they have a huge technology lag – gap to fill. So that means, for the Chinese government, they are looking for some technology like – (inaudible) – to produce biofuel from the agricultural residue and – (inaudible) – residue. So that’s the technology space – (inaudible). The Chinese government is eagerly – to promote it and encourage to – encouraged. \r\n Yeah, okay. I’ll just stop here and leave – (inaudible) – solar energy. \r\n MR. HARRIS: Okay, yes. Thanks. So – and frankly, in (east ?) China we see much less of the officials talking to us about biofuels than they do solar and wind. Every place we go to, they want to have a solar and wind energy and put it into their energy mix. But we haven’t heard that from biofuels, and we’re thinking that could be a geographic phenomenon, that other places in China may be better, and we could help you research that if you need it. \r\n Now I’d like to introduce Lisa Tang. She’s the high-tech specialist who covers the solar industry in China. \r\n LISA TANG: Hello, everybody. My name is Lisa. As Greg mentioned, solar is one of the – one of the most important renewable-energy source; is also very, very hot in China these days. \r\n As you probably are aware, China is the largest manufacturer of solar panels. In the year 2008, China manufactured two gigawatts of solar panels, which is over 30 percent of the total world capacity. And China is continuing to grow the production. \r\n So if you are in the solar business, you definitely need to come to – come to China. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n In the next slide, you will see a map of the – a map of China with the distribution of the solar-panel manufacturers. You can see, apparently, that there is a concentration on the east coast, especially in the Yangtze delta region, which is close to the city of Shanghai. \r\n The province of Jiangsu is very high focus of the solar manufacturers, with a – with some big companies like Suntech, Trina, and Chinese Energy (ph). A lot of those companies are – started in China but went IPO in overseas markets. \r\n In China nowadays, there are altogether 10 solar companies that are listed in overseas markets. Therefore, China is also subsidizing those companies to help the growth. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n China issued two policies this year, in 2009, to promote the domestic solar market. As you probably understand, that China used to export most of the panels manufactured here. But the domestic market was very – was very small compared with, like, Europe or U.S. But in – starting this year, part of the – as part of the national stimulus – economy stimulus plan, China started to promote the domestic solar market. \r\n There are two policies, in March and in July. You can read the details on the slide. Just very briefly, these policies have – are issued by the – have – are issued in combination with the ministry of finance, so there is money already there to give to companies for solar projects. And in order to enjoy the policy, you have to apply with detailed projects – (inaudible) – reserves the power to approve or disapprove that. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n And with the rising China solar market, we encouraged U.S. exporters to come to China with the listed technology, as China is still the largest manufacturer. So we first encourage the companies that can supply equipment and materials used in the manufacturing. And we especially encourage the high-end equipment and technology, because China is already trying to localize a lot of the low-end equipment. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n And the – if you are considering the China solar industry, whether you are already in the solar industry or you are trying to consider – you are a traditional company but are trying to consider entering the solar industry, please let us know, and we will try our best to help you. \r\n We had a webinar specifically on China’s PV (ph) industry in March this year. This is still available as a recorded version online. You can check the – you can download the PowerPoint. And we are planning another one early next year, so please wait for that. \r\n That’s the major point for the solar industry. I’ll give back to – (inaudible). \r\n MR. HARRIS: Okay, thank you, Lisa. And there’s one – I’m on the elephant theme today, but there’s one sort of elephant in the room for government organizations, and that’s the national development and reform commission, who is in charge of a lot of policies on pricing and approvals for large projects in China. And I won’t read all these, but there are several organizations you may want to research and meet if you come to China. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n There are lots of shows and seminars and symposiums in China, and almost to the point of seminar fatigue. But these are some of the ones we’ve come across that may be suitable for you, but there’s lots of others, some really good, some okay. But if you have a – if you find about one and have specific questions, we may be able to see if we know who will be there and what will the topics be and things like that, just for your information. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n We’ve gone over our time by quite a bit, but we did want to leave you one last resource, and that’s our contact information. And Greg, Scott, Lisa – and Andrew works with Lisa on solar. For non-solar, you can start with myself or Scott. And again, at CS, we want to help U.S. firms to export technologies and products to the China market. \r\n FCS, the Foreign Commercial Service, also participated in the China green tech report and initiative. It was a public-private, foreign/Chinese group that just did some research and some brainstorming about the future of the green-tech market, of which alternative energy was one of the key components. So they have an open-source executive summary online, free to everybody, and that’s just another resource you can use. \r\n We thank you for your time. You know, that’s not a lot of time to talk about alternative energy or energy market in China, but we did just want to give you some of the basic facts, some of the big numbers that people talk about in China, but also where we think you could really more actively participate in this market. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: Great. Thank you very much, Greg, and thank you, Scott, and thank you, Lisa, for – not only for your wealth of information but also for your availability to do this a second time. We really appreciate that. And for all of you that are watching this webinar, you have their contact information here on this screen. So if this presentation has led to any questions, please feel free to contact them with additional questions. \r\n So we’ve finished with China, and we’ll now move southeast to Thailand, where we are very lucky to have a speaker from the Thai government, Dr. Samai Jai-In, who is the – works with the Thailand house of representatives with the – in the energy standing committee. \r\n Dr. Jai-In, are you on the line? \r\n SAMAI JAI-IN: I’m on line, thank you, yes. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: Great. Are – do you have the screen? Are you able to see the PowerPoint presentations on the screen? \r\n MR. JAI-IN: Yes, I can – I can see it pretty clearly. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: Perfect. Very good. When you’re finished with one slide, if you’d just let me know, I’ll move it to the next slide. \r\n MR. JAI-IN: I’ll do that. \r\n So – do a really fast one. Hello, everyone, I’m going to be presenting a brief overview of what is being done regarding the renewable energy in Thailand, and also I’ll touch a little bit on the significance of ASEAN, because I know part of the presentation will be covering China, which is an elephant – (inaudible) – just to mention. So the ASEAN countries, somehow we have to get together and – to remain significant in the world market. \r\n Next slide, please. Next, please. \r\n When you look at ASEAN altogether, we have – we are now approaching 600 million population, and the collective GDP is 1.5 trillion (dollars) US. So we are probably way above India in terms of committed GDP – (inaudible); one-third of China and one – perhaps one-fourth of Japan in that regard. But it is growing fast. And in six years’ time, all the ASEAN economies will come together under one roof. So this is something you have to bear in mind. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And when you look at the major ASEAN five economies – that is, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore – we are all fossil-dependent. Everyone is a net importer of fossil fuels, except Malaysia, of course, who’s still exporting. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this has become one of the major reasons why we are developing our bio-energy as part of a renewable-energy push in the past decade. You can see in this slide the collective imports of crude oil. Last year it hit 3.7 million barrels a day in ASEAN. The largest one, of course, is Indonesia. Second is Singapore. Most – (inaudible) – countries who we export from – (inaudible) – Thailand. \r\n Next, please. \r\n On this slide, I show you some history of the power sector, which was pretty badly hit during the financial crisis 10 years ago. And now we are – we expect that this time around, the crisis taking place in Europe and North America should last perhaps about one or two years. So by the third quarter of next year we should see some growth, some picking up in the power sector in ASEAN. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is a broad overview of what is seen – (inaudible) – in economies in terms of biofuel development opportunities. Our country has put in some pretty good country plans in terms of the adoption of all form of alternative energies. In this graph alone, it’s – I only dictate development plan for biodiesel and ethanol. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Of course, they’re – the one to come up very strongly in this regard Thailand. But we have to overcome some of this debate, like the food and fuel crisis, the land and water capacity issue, the human security issue. And, of course, some people even blame some of our neighbors for turning some farmland into our energy crop, that it will be harmful to sustainable development or be harmful to food production. But I think from now we have to focus on the policy for rural job creation, because this is something the government – our government needs to address. \r\n Next, please. \r\n You can see in this regard, Thailand has 20 million hectares of arable land. Half of that is for rice paddy. And for rice in this region, we only – most of them, a year, can do it in – once in a year. That means we put the land to work only four months in twelve months. For the rest, of course, the family has to seek other jobs, and that is not really easy to do. That makes the productivity of our eco-sector very low. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Of course, some people have blamed that on the social inequality in southeast Asia in general. In this picture on the left-hand graph, you can see the red – (inaudible) – rice paddy. And the right-hand graph, the red color represents the section of first crop of life, meaning they are irrigated land for rice paddy. \r\n Those on the right-hand side have very high productivity. But you can see on the left-hand side, (each one ?), the land are not being put to good use, meaning just to leave it to dry under the hot, tropical sun. So we are trying to do something about it. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And of course this is the graph showing productivity of the land in square meters per year. (Inaudible) – top is, of course, Malaysia, where they have a lot of good success in terms of palm oil and rubber plantations. Most of them are part of the large agro-industry chains. The bottom – (inaudible) – of course, is Thailand, and we are looking to solve this. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is the economy in – of Thailand in the – in 2008. We are number-one exporter of several commodity, like rice, rubber, cassava. For export of sugar cane, we are number second – second only to Brazil in terms of exports. And also, all-time, we are the first producer in the world. And it is climbing up pretty fast. And this is the – part of the major pillar of renewable-energy development in Thailand. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is the acreage for energy crops. The top two – about 1 million hectares – plantation is sugar cane and cassava, which is – which are now the feedstock for our bio-ethanol program. And the bottom one, the green one, the green graph, represents the acreage for oil palm, which is – (inaudible) – really fast. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is the farm – (inaudible) – income. So all of these are – (inaudible) – commodity a year. This is quite significant for our eco-sector in Thailand. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And one more reason that we need to adopt – or adapt our social workforces really fast is that Thailand’s moving into what is called an aging society. By 2025, Thailand will be an aging-population country, similar to Japan and Germany now. But the gap between Thailand and Germany or Japan is, I would say, much longer than the window of opportunity that we have. So we need to adapt that really fast. And of course, our – (inaudible) – is (emergency ?) in that attempt. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Bio-energy in Thailand has taken root from His Majesty the King’s effort since 1985, both ethanol and biodiesel. We even have a – (inaudible) – process in the palace, demonstrating some technology for this, to convert molasses, to convert cassava into ethanol, and to convert used cooking oil and palm oil into biodiesel, which has been running for the past decade in the grand palace. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And as a result of that, as a result of that inspiration, we have a – set up a long-term plan that by 2030 Thailand, (with some luck ?), turn our agricultural industry into what you call a carbohydrate economy. We will not keep on exporting cheap commodities to the world market anymore. We will try to make do with what we have, convert the debt – (inaudible) – create new jobs. And of course, in that process, we hope to be able to turn our economy around into a better shape. \r\n Next, please. \r\n So since we look at this input in the left ‘99 piece, and in 2003 we looked at it and have a plan, and then last year we rewrite the plan, put it 15 years further. As of last year, 5 percent of total energy consumption in Thailand is renewable energy or alternative energy. By 2022, we hope to make it 20.4 percent. Of course, we’ll try to meet the 20 by 20 (ph) agenda. And we have put in a lot of programs, incentives, and government support. \r\n We have to – still have – (inaudible) – investment support to all forms of alternative-energy development: in electricity, in heat generation, in biofuels, and even in natural gas for transportation sector. This is a very ambitious plan. We are – by the end of this year, 2009, we should be able to make it more than 6.5-percent share. So there is quite a good plan to good in place. \r\n By 2020, we expect that we can save the – reduce the import of fossil fuel by $12 billion US a year, and we can generate – we will need investment from the – (inaudible) – billion US dollar a year by that time. So the steady – (inaudible) – to import, we meet the investment requirement. So, in effect, this will accrue to the capital stock of the country. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is a detail of the transportation sector, where we will try to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. And these go from 66 percent last year to 45 percent by 2022, gasoline from 28 percent to 16 percent. We developed gas for transportation from 3 percent today to 20 percent in 15 years’ time, and biofuels from, oh, 3.5 percent today to 14 percent by 2022. \r\n At the 3 percent level, Thailand is now the leading country in Asia who has adopted biofuels in the transportation sector. \r\n Next, please. \r\n This is the – Thailand has mandated E2 (ph) in the – in the country since last year, and this is the gasoline consumption. Of course, more than half of – (inaudible) – now in – (inaudible) – we blend ethanol into it. And Thailand has also adopted E85 flex-fuel model, which is putting through manufacturer and now producing flex-fuel models in the country to be able to support the government plan to help in the development of new, authentic energy. \r\n Next, please. Next, please. \r\n So the critical component of this attempt – or this policy in Thailand is that we move to diversify our agriculture – agricultural sector from food and feed export market into what is called the energy and cyber market. In the past 10 years we have put in a lot of technology and industrial (capital ?) and of course we state the political decision even though we – (inaudible) –in the past – excuse me. \r\n In the past civil administration, there are some barriers that we need to overcome, of course, like the consumer perception, like sustainability issues. And for this year we can say that Thailand is now in the top five bio-ethanol producer. And for biodiesel, we are top 10 in the world. And that’s not bad for a program that has been in place about 10 years’ time. \r\n Next, please. \r\n This is – I’m going to cover very quickly the resources that we have to – for this bio-energy program. This is for – (inaudible) – production. Thailand exports more than three-quarters of – (inaudible) – production. So we want to reduce that. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is the cassava. This is the – not a potential feedstock for ethanol program. Today Thailand has between ethanol plants and 12th – (inaudible) – using molasses, which is a byproduct from sugar cane through plants, and are using cassava in this picture. We are the world’s number one in terms of productivity and number one in terms of exports, but we are the first producer in the world behind Nigeria. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Of course, Thailand is now controlling 81 percent of the cassava or tapioca in terms of starch exports in the world. And – but in the future, it’ll be interesting to see the impact of that. \r\n Next, please. \r\n It might actually mean that there’ll be more export market for corn starch, for example. \r\n Next, please. \r\n This is the ethanol fuel projects all over the country. Most of them are concentrated in the eastern part of the country, or northeastern part. \r\n Next, please. Next, please. \r\n And this is the future plan. So by 2011, we will have a very strong sector for ethanol in our gasoline markets. And, of course, for biodiesel, we’ll (begin ?) to mandate B5 by 2011. And B10 will be given some – a tax incentive as an option for the consumer. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And some people will ask, how could Thailand grow more bioenergy crops? In fact, this is another problem. We have a pretty good tropical climate, and you can see in this picture we are in the same belt as Nigeria, in the same belt as the central – or southern America – American countries. So we should be able to do that in a pretty good way. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is, of course, the palm oil – (inaudible) – expansion plant. \r\n Next, please. \r\n It’s above 1 million acres for the next few years. And by 2012, about half of the palm oil production in Thailand will go for bio-energy, or (other ?) chemical (feeds ?). Another half will be for – the other half will be for food sector and the export sector. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this is an example of what we have been able to do in terms of converting the arable land in the northern part of Bangkok and used that to grow oil palm, which is – has a very high yield. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And in a sense you can solve what we call the acidic-soil problem. And this is one other good example. \r\n I’ll go to the last slide. I don’t think we have time to cover all these issues. But I would like to say that the way forward for Thailand is that there are still a lot of challenges. There’s still a lot of barrier in terms of the export and import and other things. And we are now putting in a pretty good plan. \r\n And we’re not only talking about Thailand at the moment; we are looking to mobilize the whole – the ASEAN economy to come into this education program of our agricultural commodity. And there is a huge opportunity for investment. In Thailand, we need about 10 billion (dollars) a year in terms of investment. And I expect that the total ASEAN market will be three or four times that. \r\n And speaking of – we have also – (inaudible) – institute strongly in terms of palm oil. We are seeking new opportunity – investment opportunity for ASEAN country in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, which is – even when we can’t engage them in the – in this new investment opportunity, it’ll be good, because that will serve a lot of – (inaudible) – (job program ?) that we have. \r\n I’ll close with that. I will say that Thailand is now pretty well prepared to join the leaders in bioenergy and renewable-energy sector in the world. I don’t have time to cover all other issue, like solar, which is a rich – (inaudible) – sector in Thailand as well; hydro and so forth. We are now putting in something like 2,000 megawatts of wind farm all over the country. And there are other issues. I’ll be happy to follow up on e-mail questions if you – if you have any inquiries afterward. \r\n Thank you for your attention. \r\n MR. HARRIS: Thank you very much, Doctor. Really appreciate your time. One real quick question for you. You’ve talked a lot about the bioenergy sector and all of the opportunities with regard to, you know, the agriculture. Are there specific opportunities beyond investment for U.S. companies in this bioenergy sector, possibly for equipment or something of that nature? \r\n MR. JAI-IN: Of course. There is a lot of – I know that the U.S. has a very strong automotive sector – well, at least in terms of capacity you have. That is something that I hope that big three in the American motor auto sector will come in and do something about it in the Thai market – and, of course, not only Thai market, in ASEAN as well, in auto parts. \r\n And also, in terms of the high-tech and the second-generation biofuels, RSO (ph) or even battery. At the moment, we have a lot of interest in electricity and hybrid units. I think battery will some of the issue that technology company in the U.S. can come in and see what we can do in terms of the Thai market or the ASEAN market as such. \r\n MR. HARRIS: Great. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and your availability to do this just one week after our original event. So thank you very much. \r\n MR. JAI-IN: Thank you – you’re welcome – to talk to you again. \r\n MR. HARRIS: Great. Alan (sp), are you on the line? \r\n ALAN CHIN (sp): Yes, I’m on the line. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: Perfect, Alan. Are you going to be using the presentation that we had from the speaker last week? \r\n MR. CHIN: Yes, exactly. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: Okay. It should be on – do you see it on your screen? \r\n MR. CHIN: Yup. \r\n MR. HAMILTON: Okay, perfect. Why don’t we go ahead and get started. Alan is the commercial specialist in Taipei for the Commercial Service, and he handles the energy sector, among others. And so Alan will be talking now about green-energy opportunities and industry in Taiwan. \r\n So Alan, just like with the other speakers, when you’re ready for the slides to go to the next one, just say “next slide.” \r\n MR. CHIN: Okay. Hi, everyone. This is Alan Chin from U.S. Commercial Service Taipei. Really, I’m glad to have this opportunity to share some opinions about Taiwan’s opportunities on the green energy. \r\n And actually, the very beginning part of the PowerPoint material prepared by Dao Zedong Xuxing (ph). But Dao Zedong Xuxing (ph) is the deputy director of ITRI’s green-energy office. ITRI is, in fact, Industrial Technology Research Institute, which is instituted, totally sponsored by Taiwan’s MOEA. MOEA is ministry of economic affairs. So in this PowerPoint, some of Taiwan’s government policy and (accord ?) will be conveyed during the Power (sic) presentation. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n In this PowerPoint, basically, we will cover three topics. One, we will talk about governmental policy on Taiwan’s green-energy industry. And basically, secondly, we will share some opinions about the best prospect in Taiwan, which will be photovoltaics, LED, wind and electrical vehicles. And finally we will do some kind of conclusions for the reference of U.S. companies that expect to export your service or product to Taiwan. \r\n Next, please. \r\n As compared to the mainland China, everybody knows actually Taiwan’s market is quite small, actually. But most of the time, all the – (inaudible) – are right now, including the U.S. companies, then we’ll have a perspective called the Greater China Area. The Greater China Area will include, of course, mainland China, and also Hong Kong, Macau, and finally Taiwan. \r\n Taiwan, even though our domestic market’s not so big – however, Taiwan has been playing a very important, key role in the manufacturing base in the world. Especially, we have a very excellent success in the ICP (ph) industry. Everybody knows that maybe most of the world’s desktop computers and notebook computers and even more platforms are manufactured either in Taiwan or in the mainland China plants operated by Taiwan companies. \r\n So sometimes, when we – when we are talking about some sectors in Taiwan, usually we are highly connected to U.S. companies, taking a broader view, thinking about Taiwan’s advantage if you have a strong interest to export your product and service to the Greater China Area. \r\n So in Taiwan, about the green-energy sector, actually, Taiwan has set a very clear score about sustainable-energy policy, which included a CO2 emissions reduction, low-carbon energy, power generation. And just recently, the Taiwan government has (agreed ?) the so-called sunlight program that we’re promoting even further about Taiwan’s green-energy development. \r\n And then finally, just this past June we have – Taiwan has just passed an act called the renewable-energy development act. In this act, the government is totally authorized to provide some subsidiary to promote any kind of renewable energy, which include solar, include wind, include – (inaudible) – and so on. Right now, Taiwan’s government is negotiating closely with the industry to decide the subsidiary model to further promote the development of Taiwan for the new energy sector. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And Taiwan’s – actually, we have a very clear (goal ?). Basically, we will cover three central – (inaudible) – to development in Taiwan as Taiwan’s sustainable-energy development policy. \r\n First of all, we will focus on efficiency, because in Taiwan we have many quite mature industries. For example, petrochemical; for example, textile; for example, food production. All these sectors, they use a lot of energy. And some of their equipment has some – takes some basis to include their efficiency. For example, most of the companies in the petrochemical industry, they use lots of – (inaudible) – in their process. So lots of efforts with their use to increase the efficiency to be – the efficiency for this equipment in different mature sectors. \r\n Secondly, Taiwan will have a goal to increase – (inaudible) – so we have some kind of – just as mentioned in a previous slide, we have a clear goal to review the CO2 emissions. And we also try to find some kind of alternative – for example, IGCC, integrated gasification combined cycle, a metric to be used by Taiwan’s major utilities for power generation. \r\n Lastly, because Taiwan will rely maybe more than 98 percent on the import of foreign energy sources, so recently we also – we focused on the severity of Taiwan’s energy supply. So recently, even though we have already four nuclear power plants in Taiwan and right now the government’s saying that maybe we have to expand some nuclear power – (inaudible) – to be used to maintain Taiwan’s (superiority ?) of energy supply. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay, this is talking about energy efficiency or about the energy conservation topic that you can see in this slide. Every year the government has set a 2-percent increase to help the whole industry to increase their equipment efficiency, energy savings. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay, this is – because lots of sectors are related to the energy. So in Taiwan, basically we focus on four different approaches. One is about the industry and energy sector. The other one is, of course, transportation sector. And the last one is the residential and the government sector. So for each different sector, Taiwan’s government has already set very – (inaudible) – goal for them to do the – for them to pursue in the – to do the energy conservation as their goal in the future. \r\n Next, please. \r\n This slide shows a total – for example, like, an action plan, because we have a vision, just as I’ve already mentioned in previous slide, because in Taiwan we have a vision to create an energy-saving society and a low-carbon economy. So of course we have to develop some kind of action plan. So in this slide you can see that the Taiwan government has already selected two industries as the pillar industries. One is the photovoltaic. The other one is LED lights. \r\n In addition to that, we also identified five potential industries, which include the wind; electrical vehicles; EICT; biomass; hydrogen, the fuel cell, as another five potential industries. So in the future, the two pillar industry and these five potential industry will be targeted by Taiwan as a goal to help Taiwan to achieve its – Taiwan’s vision – (inaudible) – society and the low-carbon economy. \r\n Next, please. \r\n So this is a challenging plan. So once Taiwan has located the two pillar industries and the five additional industries to be – to be targeted for future promotion. So first of all we have to identify what the industrial capacity is in Taiwan. As already mentioned, Taiwan’s markets – (inaudible) – more. \r\n And the Taiwan – Taiwanese companies, Taiwanese government usually has a very established philosophy that we would like to identify first of all what kind of strengths the Taiwan companies, they already have, and what kind of collaborations (happen/habit ?) or cooperation measures that we can develop to cooperate with founding suppliers and founding vendors and to work together for a common target – market target. \r\n So this slide shows that basically we have to identify our industrial (capacity ?) and – (inaudible) – cooperation with founding suppliers and founding vendors, we can identify the common target. For example, we can identify the Greater China as a whole market and we can – the U.S. companies can take advantage of Taiwan’s – already has a strength to enter this Asia target. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay. So you can see that in this slide – because ICT is Taiwan’s most successful industry. And based on the rapid growth of ICT, Taiwan has established a very adaptive manufacturing base for any kind of related technology or related component. So in this light, we put the ICT in the center of this action plan, and it was put with PV, put above photovoltaic and – (inaudible) – and other potential industries. And we put them together, trying to enhance the strength that we already have and trying to gather some other responses from foreign companies and to work together to convey a common market and wind-energy industry. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay, so for the major industries, I already identified in the slide – it’s solar, PV, LED wind and electro – (inaudible). We do have some kind of – (inaudible) – goals to be pursued in the following year. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And you can see this is for the – for the solar, for advanced voltaics. Taiwan, especially right now, we have been at the – number fourth largest power cell manufacturer in the world. And you can see from this slide, actually, the government and industry have set a very aggressive goal for us to pursue in the following years. \r\n Next, please. \r\n And this slide shows something I think would be very valuable for the benefit of U.S. companies. Everybody knows that within the industry of solar power, actually, there is a very long supply chain, even though right now Taiwan is number four largest manufacturer of solar cell. But for the raw material, for example, the ingot and the wafer, and for the downstream areas such as the module and – (inaudible) – we still have to – we still do not have lots of established manufacturing capability. \r\n And even for the manufacturing of a power cell – power cell, usually the Taiwanese companies, they import the equipment and find supplier from the European companies, Japanese companies, and from USA company. \r\n So Taiwan has already put PV solar industry as one of the pillar industry of their sunlight program. And you can see in the whole supply chain of the power solar manufacturing, including the very downstream of – (inaudible) – system, the USA companies can find opportunities to stay in Taiwan, either the very upstream raw material or some kind of key component for the Taiwanese company to be used in either assembly of the module, in the – (inaudible) – system. And even they can (sell ?) a lot of good equipment to the Taiwanese company, for them to manufacture solar cell. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay. This slide also show our – show Taiwan’s solar industry development strategy. So you can see that in the central – we put a powerful system-integration plant. So Taiwan – we already know that most of Taiwanese companies in the solar power industry, their strength is manufacturing. Their strength is mass production. However, they need upstreams of raw material. They need the equipment to be used. And they need some kind of market development ability. \r\n So all these things can be used by USA company. If you are going to sell raw materials to Taiwan, if you are going to sell manufacturing equipment to Taiwan, then you are going to find some kind of partner of a solar system. I think that you can think of Taiwan as your first consideration to develop your international business. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay. This is for the full area. I mentioned that if you are USA company, if you really think – if you can find some company in Taiwan and you can identify even more. For example, if your business category is about – (inaudible) – solar cell or – (inaudible) – thin film or your commerce chains is in ingot or wafer, or PV module, all these three or four areas you can find the potential to work with Taiwanese companies. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Just as solar-cell industry, the other here industries, called LED. Actually, the Taiwan government philosophy is quite simple. Because, as I mentioned before, Taiwan has been very successful in the manufacturing of ICT industry, and we are very successful in the families – families of plants to manufacture lots of different kinds of semiconductors. So the solar cell and – (inaudible) – these two industries are quite related to the semiconductor industry. So that’s the reason why the Taiwan government and industry selected solar cell, solar power and LED as the two pillar industries in the green industry. \r\n So this is – this slide is talking about Taiwan’s goals about how to develop LED lighting in the near future. Just recently – because right now, the Taiwan situation – the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland China is getting better and better. So sometimes – especially sometimes, China government, they will give a special opportunity for Taiwanese company to export their products to mainland China. For example, recently, the – after the coordination of China’s government, they already coordinated more than – more than dozens of cities that they are going to use the LED lighting systems manufactured by Taiwan. \r\n However, in Taiwan, this change has only – we only have the chance to manufacture the LED itself. However, to over – to produce LED light systems, we see a need for lots of other vendors’ and suppliers’ support. \r\n Next slide, please. \r\n So you can see that on the left-hand side – left-hand side, we listed some – we listed some weaknesses, actually, if I can use the word. However, Taiwan’s weakness will be the opportunities for USA companies. For example, we do not – we here do not have a very stable supply of the upstream material. And we were quite short on component and manufacturing technology. And we are quite weak on the – on the systems products – (inaudible). And finally, it’s very hard for the Taiwanese companies to find the market entrance path. And also, we are quite – (inaudible) – on future needs. \r\n So these kinds of weakness for Taiwanese company will be the opportunities for USA companies. So U.S. companies, you could think, this – (inaudible) – is your chances that you can take advantage of Taiwan-based company, which are shown on the right-hand side. For example, we have a very superior – our mass production of this kind of LED, LED cells, and we’re also quite flexible on business operation. And we can provide (timing ?) – (inaudible). And finally, this is very popular for capital investors. \r\n So for the USA company, if you have an interest to incorporate the LED as one kind of component in your final system, I think the Taiwanese companies will be your effective partner to manufacture the final product for your company. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Talking about – after talking about the two pillar industries, solar power and LEDs, right now we go through very frequently about the wind-power opportunity in Taiwan. As I already mentioned, Taiwan is a small island. We do not have – Taiwan itself is not a very big market. However, Taiwan has started its wind-power generation project maybe about since five years ago. Actually, the Taiwan power company, the only utility in Taiwan, has installed lots of wind turbines along the island. \r\n But for the USA company I think – for your companies, quite specialized in so-called offshore power – wind-power system. You can find some opportunity in the – in the near future, because you can see that between mainland China and Taiwan, there is Taiwan Strait, okay, Taiwan Strait. And, you know, Taiwan Strait is a sea water level. It’s quite shallow. \r\n So it’s easy for us to build some kind of offshore wind farm in the Taiwan Strait and just connect it – the wind farm to the Taiwan island. So if your company is specialized in this offshore wind-power generation, I think you can find some opportunity in Taiwan. And we are very glad to introduce you to the Taiwan power company to make any kind of successful business transaction for your company. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay. This is – this slide also mentions some kind of targeted strategy about Taiwan’s wind-power development. So you can see there is – of course we target some kind of research and development. We talk about something about the industry. For example, because most of the key components right now are still imported from foreign suppliers. And so we hope the Taiwanese companies, they can provide some kind of maintenance service after the announcement of this wind farm. And we also hope we can join some kind of standard preparation, and a standard – (inaudible) – in the world. \r\n Of course, if a USA company, you can find the Taiwanese companies as your partner, the Taiwanese companies are more than happy to be your manufacturing base in Asia, and also, we can target any kind of potential market in the mainland China area, and also the southeastern Asia area. \r\n Next, please. \r\n Okay. Finally, we are talking about something about the electrical vehicles. Actually, for the time being, Taiwan has sometimes, just like the – (inaudible) – before, Taiwan’s quite successful in ICT. And everybody knows – no good for a mobile phone. They need lots of batteries. \r\n So some kind of – some Taiwanese companies specialize in the manufacture of batteries and have already devoted their efforts for the batteries to be used by any kind of electrical vehicle, such as for the automobile. Maybe it’s much more challenging for Taiwanese companies. But right now we are quite successful to provide batteries to be used by motorcycles and some kind of very light battery (coat ?) to be used in the sports industry. \r\n Next, please. \r\n So right now I’d point you – offer some kind of conclusion for the rest of the USA companies. As I – as I mentioned before, Taiwan itself is not a very big market. However, Taiwan has such a wonderful location, just very near to the mainland China. And right now the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China is getting better and better. And Taiwan’s being very successful in the industry of ICT and the semiconductors. So identifying the Taiwanese strengths, the Taiwanese government and industry has already selected solar PV and LED as two of the pillar industries to be developed in the green-energy industry. \r\n So any U.S. company, if you have any kind of equipment, any kind of technology, any kind of service, and your main target is in the Greater China Area or southeastern Asian countries, you can really think of Taiwan as your best partner, even a manufacturing partner or a marketing partner, because of Taiwan’s – we really have a very unique and special location and a very special position in the manufacturing supply chains around the world. So this is – we use very limited time to offer you some kind of very detailed information for your reference if you have interest to enter Asia market. \r\n So if you have any questions, you can contact me directly. We are more than happy to – (inaudible) – and offer you any kind of counseling opinion or any kind of research – (inaudible) – for your reference. \r\n Thank you very much. Thank you, Jeff. \r\n MR.

RAFAEL PEÑA, \r\n CUSTOMS BROKER/INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE SPECIALIST; \r\n DIRECTOR GENERAL, \r\n GRUPO EI \r\n   \r\n Transcript by \r\n Federal News Service \r\n Washington, D.C. \r\n   \r\n OPERATOR: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. \r\n I would now like to turn the meeting over to Laura Gimenez. You may begin. \r\n LAURA GIMENEZ: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Laura Gimenez. I’m the commercial officer in Monterrey, Mexico. I will be moderating today’s session. We have three speakers lined up. Let me get started by introducing Ms. Karen Zens, our minister counselor for commercial affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City, who will deliver the welcoming remarks. \r\n Karen, please. \r\n KAREN ZENS: Thank you, Laura. I thank everyone for joining us today. As Laura said, I’m at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico. I’m in charge of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Commercial Service operations here in Mexico. The Commercial Service is the part of the U.S. government dedicated to helping U.S. companies get started in exporting or open new markets for them. And we have a particular focus on small- and medium-sized companies, although we are happy to help all U.S. companies sell their products and services in markets overseas. \r\n Mexico is one of the most important markets for U.S. exporters, and so we have a large operation in Mexico. We have four offices here in Mexico City at the embassy; in Monterrey, the office which has organized this webinar today; as well as Guadalajara and Tijuana. \r\n We offer a variety of services to help U.S. companies: everything from identifying potential partners, doing background checks on those partners, organizing trade events, taking delegations to the United States and providing market information and market research. And in fact, we can customize services to the needs of our American-company clients. \r\n Today’s webinar is an excellent example of one of our services, which is to bring very useful and practical information to help companies successfully export. This webinar today is really focusing on new exporters or new exporters to Mexico. So it is filled with very practical and basic information. Perhaps more experienced exporters already know this information, but it’s very important for companies to help them successfully export. \r\n I’m particularly pleased that you’re joining us today to talk about Mexico, because Mexico unfortunately has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately, whether it’s because of concerns about an upswing in violence along the border because the Mexican government has been taking on the drug cartels, and as a result, there has been additional increased violence; or because of the most recent problem, which is the flu epidemic, the H1N1 flu influenza, which could have started anywhere in the world, but unfortunately for Mexico started in Mexico. \r\n And the Mexican government has been taking very aggressive measures to prevent its spread. And we applaud those measures. And now with the recent decision yesterday by the World Health Organization, they are encouraging all countries to take appropriate measures to prevent its spread. \r\n Despite these not-very-positive newsworthy items, Mexico continues to be an outstanding market for U.S. companies. In fact, we exported $151 billion to Mexico last year. It’s our second-largest export market, second only to Canada. \r\n So once again, I’m very pleased that you’ve joined us today. I think this is going to be a very helpful and informational webinar. And with no further ado, I’m going to turn it back to Laura so we get to the real speakers. Thank you all. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Thank you, Karen. \r\n In today’s program, I would like to introduce Manuel Velazquez, who is our trade specialist here in U.S. Marshals Service Monterrey, and also in charge of customs for Mexico. \r\n Also with us is Rafael Peña, who is a Mexican custom broker and director general of Grupo EI. With 30 offices in Mexico, Grupo EI is one of the best alternatives in foreign trade, custom clearance and logistics. They offer management transportation, trade and services, supply-chain logistic analysis, HTC – (inaudible) – certification and other services. \r\n Mr. Peña has over 20 years of experience in customs and is frequently the speaker in the U.S. about Mexican customs. \r\n If you have any questions throughout the presentation, please use the chat feature on this webinar. And we will also take questions for you at the end of the session with a Q\u0026amp;A, and the operator will open up the line. \r\n So Rafael and Manuel, why don’t you both start telling us what the five most common mistakes to avoid for new exporters are. \r\n MANUEL VELAZQUEZ: Okay. Let’s start. I think it’s important to let you know that we have a lot of (attendants ?) now. And I think this could be nice. At the same time, this could be scary because, like Rafael said before, probably many people have scare about the Mexican custom. And this could be very good – (inaudible) – or very good information you know, what is the basics of the customs in Mexico. \r\n And we’re going to start with a little introduction. Rafael? \r\n LIC. RAFAEL PEÑA: Thank you, Manuel. Well, thanks, everybody, and thanks for the invitation. First of all, I want to tell you that this is a very – (inaudible) – of looking at the importations into Mexico, which is something good because it’s not boring. I’m not talking about articles or laws or anything. It’s just what happens in the day-to-day operation in the border. \r\n And it starts also with saying that the reason why you see most of the warehouses on the American side is that in Mexico, the responsibility of the importations into our country is shared by the importer (of record ?) and we as the licensed custom brokers. It’s different than in the United States, because in the U.S., that’s what I know from our colleagues that we work together is that most of the – of something – if something happens in customs, they – (inaudible) – something happens, it’s more common to have a license of the importer (of record ?) canceled or suspended rather than the licensed broker itself. \r\n So we as custom brokers in Mexico – that’s why you see a lot of verification – checking goods, checking documents. And that’s also a bad thing by the other hand, because it seems like we’re so bureaucratic. But that’s how the rules are in Mexico, and that’s – it’s the reason why as well. Most of the contraband come to Mexico and not go backwards. It’s just – or country (it’s from). So that’s why it’s like this. \r\n We start it at the relationship. It’s very important. When the relationship starts between the U.S. seller to a Mexican buyer, most of U.S. sellers, they are selling goods using – just put in place, where I need to send my goods, and I’ll send them over there, and that’s about it. I don’t intend to know more about my merchandise than that. \r\n It goes along much, much more than that. And many times, they don’t know that their merchandise gets stopped in the border, the reasons why their merchandise gets stopped. So it starts from – that’s why I always – I always recommend that you at least know or have some information who you’re selling to – if it’s a company, if it’s a person, if it exists, if it’s just a commercial people, if it’s a broker, if it’s anybody who – what kind of company does this – exists in the other side of the border? There’s just a person who wants to introduce something into our country, because that is a lot of help, also, you can attend or give them before even sending the goods to the border. \r\n Okay. The must-know information before shipping the material – very, very important, and that – I’m going to put a – (inaudible) – to my presentation. Does the importer have an importing permit, which we call it – (in Spanish). Remember Spanish is like – (inaudible) – so I don’t if that’s a correct translation, but it’s an importer permit. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: It’s like the national record that provides you – the government – the government – the Mexican government provides to the Mexican importer in order to import in Mexico. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Very simple questions. It has a lot – a lot of help – a lot of help to whoever’s buying your merchandise. Why is this? We get a lot of calls, even when you talk about air freight, for example, of a person that purchased the materials from the U.S. It arrives to the airport. He already paid for transportation. (Inaudible) – international air-freight transportation. And what happens when it gets to customs, happens that the importer recorder does not – the company or the person does have an importer (of record ?) permit. \r\n So everything is just suspended without cost. You shouldn’t even ask for the goods to get through our (customs ?). So the main thing – those most important – (inaudible) – that I will always recommend of sellers to do from the United States. \r\n Am I manufacturing the product, or am I reselling it? It happens a lot as well that when we get goods into the airports or into the border, we get an – (inaudible) – certificate. And when we go physically to check the goods, it says “China” or it says some place of Europe or any country. And that’s a big thing in Mexico; that’s a big problem in Mexico. \r\n So it is very important to know that you should have your support in case you’re not the manufacturer, of showing what’s the correct origin or your merchandise. I am – if I am reselling the goods, do I already know the country of origin that goes along with what I sent previously? So if my product qualifies as NAFTA origin, that’s a lot – it is not the same that the origin or the country where I’m selling the goods from. You need to know if really you can extend a NAFTA certificate – if it qualifies for NAFTA, that goes along to another – probably another seminar completely – webinar of NAFTA. But it goes along with the NAFTA treaty between our countries. You cannot just extend a NAFTA certificate and sign for it and then get a responsibility if you are not sure that it qualifies – (inaudible). \r\n I think it’s – could be interesting – you could say one or two advantage of – to be on a NAFTA – (inaudible). One of them is that you pay less duties per country. You just have to be NAFTA – the importer – the importer in Mexico. \r\n MR. : Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: In fact, it’s – for you, it’s good to compete, because if you’re competing with other countries, getting your products into Mexico, you have an advantage that typically you don’t pay import duties – well, as long as probably a month before – (inaudible) – before that month of those – (inaudible) – products that they change for paying duties into Mexico, but you don’t pay import duties into Mexico. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Your client’s going to be more happy because of them – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Of course. And that’s why – that’s why many times they ask for NAFTA, you give it, and you (shouldn’t ?) give the NAFTA. That’s why it’s very important to know if you qualify. \r\n And another one is that typically also the permits, they’re a lot less, how can I say, mandatory, for the NAFTA region, for the NAFTA products as well. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: And as – (inaudible) – obviously, the shipping country is not always the country of origin. That’s also very typical in our day-to-day operations. \r\n Do I know how to fill out a NAFTA certificate? If you don’t know how to fill it, it’s better to ask and to fill it the correct way instead of don’t do it correctly and then in the future operation or when the goods are – (inaudible) – to the border and you cannot apply for it, then you ask for – (inaudible) – NAFTA, then it’s a back and forth sending of documents. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: In this case, Rafael, who can help you to fill the NAFTA certification? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Typically, even your commerce offices in your – in your city where you are or even the custom broker can send you an example saying – (inaudible) – like this. Just you put the description, the – (inaudible) – the classification A, B, C, D according to what the product is. And there’s always, even in the – what – (inaudible) – information, that you can get – (inaudible). \r\n And if you still have – (inaudible) – either Manuel or myself, you can always – it is better to ask. I always say that. \r\n Does the material goods require a special importing permit? That’s very important. If you’re telling me you’re sending a chemical, you will typically need a permit coming into Mexico. So it’s very important to know in advance if your product will need a special import permit into our country. That can always be known in advance – simple as sending a picture, sending the (MSDS ?) – well, I don’t know exactly the words of what is the chemical. It’s – (inaudible) – all those support help us to come to a – to a – (inaudible) – will help us to know if you need an import permit or not. \r\n I always – and I should have said this in the beginning – but I always say that 90 percent of things to be done before getting a product into the country can be done in advance of the merchandise getting into the border. So all this can be done in advance. I’m sorry that I didn’t mention this. \r\n This is also – (inaudible) – the insurance is so – under which definition – and believe me, there’s a lingo between crossing the border, between getting into a place in the border and then getting into a shipping – (inaudible) – in Mexico. That crossing of the bridge makes sure that it’s always covered by your insurance company. And if it’s covered, already – the insurance company you need to declare it because it’s part of the evaluation of the goods, so it’s also a very important thing. \r\n I always ask to the importer so your merchandise has insurance. And they can go back and forth with the supplier and the transportation company. So it’s very important to know – (inaudible) – ship the goods. \r\n Does the material shipped correspond to what was bought? Many times as well, they ask you for several amounts of material, and you’re going to send – (inaudible) – or – (inaudible) – sometimes according to you sending samples. It’s very important to know before it gets there. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Because this is one of the big problems that we have here in Mexico. The Mexican authorities – I don’t know, they have like a special care about these kinds of situation where you send more product than the invoice says, right? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well, it’s – (inaudible) – contraband. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Yes. \r\n MR. PEÑA: (Inaudible) – mistake. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: This is – this very important to know. \r\n MR. PEÑA: So it’s a big thing. In fact, I always say that if you’re going to ship something, always – (inaudible). You’re missing an extra amount of products from this kind of – (inaudible) – number, typically the shipper will know before they send or their department, but we never know until it gets to the border. So it’s more like we’re doing the examination work – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Yes. \r\n MR. PEÑA: – and all – most of the time, it can be known in advance. \r\n When we talk about (statistics ?) before entering, mistake number one, from the goods that arrive to the border, some 100 percent of the goods that arrive – because I’m not – (inaudible) – very good sample of what I receive from many types of importers into Mexico, 30 percent of the goods arrive without a certificate of origin when they can apply for it. \r\n Why is this so important? This is important because with – (inaudible) – the product in a very – (inaudible) – matter, I need to apply the NAFTA certificate to get that advantage as an importer of record in Mexico. If I don’t have the NAFTA certificate, then I will import it and pay duties for it. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: This is – this, I think, is important, because there are many companies that their product doesn’t apply as a NAFTA. They just – the only difference between a NAFTA product and a non-NAFTA product is they’re going to pay their duties, right? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. Besides that, there’s merchandise that you can always tell, if it says “Made in USA,” that it’s American, but you still don’t have enough to – (off mic). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Oh, okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: They need to – (inaudible). They need to (clear ?) customs. Sometimes they have a – (inaudible) – it’s been stopped – (inaudible) – so they import it. They still have one year to go and claim those – (inaudible) – duties. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Ah, this is a good point, that ID number. \r\n MR. PEÑA: For the future. But what happens is that typically that year goes on and they never can – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Oh, okay. Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: So it is 30 percent of the merchandise that should apply for NAFTA – (off mic). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Twenty-five percent of them are typically new – (inaudible) – numbers that we need to classify. And when I talk about classifying, it is physically going, opening the product, look at the product, ask for pictures, ask for information of what functions that it’s – what it’s made of, what materials it’s made of. So it’s a lot of information we need to know with a – (inaudible) – number. (Inaudible) – coming back. If I’m a seller, I’m sending my goods to one buyer in Mexico. And I typically send them these – (inaudible) – numbers. When I’m sending a new – (inaudible) – number, I can know it for my system. If I send – (inaudible) – saying I’m sending this part number or this part number substitutes, these are the ones – just 100 percent new. I’m sending you the information in advance to know what it is, what material its constituted of, what is it for. I can go ahead and classify it before it gets to my dock in the wharf. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: That’s a lot of information that can be advanced. \r\n (Inaudible) – verify that 80 percent come with unusable commercial invoices. So we have to go and (protest ?) those invoices and make descriptions of what comes in the – in the invoice. Why is this? Because when I – (inaudible) – (PAR ?) number that’s in the invoice that does not have a description in English or Spanish – it could be in French as well – but in English or Spanish, I don’t know what the merchandise is. Even – I need to process – (inaudible) – means I need to type in the back of the invoice what I’m talking about, what the goods are, because in case of an inspection, they need to know what they’re – what they’re checking. \r\n So it’s just like also the rules you have in your country that has to (come with a description ?) and you have to put in the merchandise – (inaudible) – mostly about the same. Just we ask always to try to put them as clear as we can. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: There’s a fine if you don’t provide on a – you know, on a clear invoice? Or why so – you know, why it’s too high, the percentage of – to see these unusual commercial invoice – why? \r\n MR. PEÑA: It’s just because the systems of the – of the sellers are very – (inaudible) – very strict, that you cannot type in information. So they go like that – the merchandise – (inaudible) – like that, but in the border, most of the time even the sellers don’t know what kind of work needs to be done to those invoices. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: They need to be in communication with the people from the export side. \r\n MR. PEÑA: So, as I say, if that information can be done in advance, it will always prevent – (inaudible) – time from – (inaudible) – the invoices. Okay. \r\n Packaging, it’s a big thing always. Forty percent of the goods that we receive in our warehouses, they come with packaging that is damaged, that it’s – something’s broken – that we need to – (inaudible) – so it’s also a big problem in the border. \r\n All this – (inaudible) – so we’re trying to avoid – (inaudible) – across as fast as we can. \r\n Okay. This is – was the introduction. Now we’re going to start with mistake number one. That is misclassification. I think this is one of the key factors of – to have a successful and happy export experience in Mexico. \r\n Okay. I put an example here of some – (inaudible) – schedule or – (inaudible) – that sometimes even with a NAFTA certificate, they send – (inaudible) – certification, they don’t get to the border, we go and find out that it’s another classification. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: I think it’s interesting because I think we have many people who are – (inaudible) – export – (inaudible). \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. The – (inaudible) – is a number named now by the World Customs Organization that all the goods should be classified in that – (inaudible) – a world-wide (code ?). Some of them variate by the end of the two or four numbers – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: I think the internationals are the six, first number, and then we have the other two for Mexico. And the other two – (inaudible) – but right now we are working with – (inaudible). \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes, yes. So whenever there’s a difference, there’s two things that happen. I cannot apply to NAFTA if there’s a difference even – (inaudible) – or I just import it with a correction, because I am – (inaudible) – broker. Is it one, legal, liable for the – (inaudible) – in Mexico? Either they change the NAFTA certificate or they (put ?) me – or they send me the backup information saying no, no, no. (Inaudible) – this is not a plastic part. This is about – because of this, this, this or that. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: The characteristics. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Then, the characteristics, the information, a brochure – I recommend always to have websites. I remember – and I gave this example as well – I remember importing for a customer that needs to have a website when he can always go and change your part number and look at the product with all the information there. So you can always get the – (inaudible) – correct. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: You know, because this – (inaudible) – important and – (inaudible) – factor here that, it depends your industry. I understand. You know, the same, if you are sending a screw or, I don’t know – it depends for which industry is – (inaudible) – classification. (I understand that ?). \r\n MR. PEÑA: Not just the classification, Manuel. One – (inaudible) – could have a permit – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: And the other one will not have a permit. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Yes. \r\n MR. PEÑA: So even if – if you think that – (inaudible) – you can use, send your goods, you get stopped on the border, then there’s another criteria – (inaudible) – certification. I mean, that merchandise can get stopped until you get the permit. So you’re talking about time, about sending the information back and forth. Again, you can always have this information in advance. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: A simple catalog description, function of the – what it’s made of, can be a very, very exact – (inaudible) – of what we are planning to – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: And – (inaudible) – because we know that there’s some certificate like this – (inaudible) – of, say – (inaudible) – of (pre-sales ?) and you go (not easy ?) because they – (inaudible) – no? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. (Inaudible.) \r\n MR. PEÑA: Number two. \r\n MR. VALUEZQUEZ: Valuation. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Valuations. Mexico is – it’s sometimes complicated on determining the value of the goods. Most of the goods have a market value. So that market value should be the one – (inaudible) – on the imports into Mexico. \r\n Obviously, the country of origin influences on the duty because it impacts the value (upon ?) Mexican customs. But what I recommend is that when you’re going to send something with a discount, or you’re going to send something for free because they’re going to – (inaudible) – a sample of something, it’s right to communicate to the (reporter ?) or to the broker so they will always know why is that different. \r\n I’m going to give you an example. I remember importing some scooters into Mexico. So when we got to customs, even though it was a green light, they say they had a suspicious undervaluation of the goods. So they stopped the merchandise. It was 7:00 in the afternoon. They say – (inaudible) – I need – I could let you go, but if it’s okay with you, I need to verify this valuation with the supplier. \r\n I could – I could be strict on my (customs ?) employee to let me go, but, you know, you always work with those guys every day. So I said, okay, I have nothing to hide. Go ahead and check the valuation. \r\n What they did next day is they went on the web and looked at the values of the goods. And then they say, well, these are 30 percent under price of a typical market value. They called the supplier from Mexican customs. And they said, we’re going to need – (inaudible) – for this importer of record. Can you verify that these goods cost this amount or this much? They say yes, it was a special offer that we did this month. And you’re exactly right; that invoice that you’re looking at is the correct valuation. \r\n Okay, thank you, and then they let me go. So valuation is also a big thing in Mexico that you will always need to check. And by the other hand, sometimes it’s not on the (hands ?) of the – of the seller. Sometimes the importer of record can go and put some liquid paper to the invoice, put it undervalue, import it and pay less duties for it. That’s a very common thing – I’m sorry to say this – with people that they don’t have a good accounting information in the company. And why do I say this? Because importing something that you pay $100 for it and you’re importing it on $80 for it, it’s not even deductible for the Mexican customs. So they don’t have – they don’t – they don’t know – they don’t have something to prove that what – (inaudible) – is what they import for. \r\n So it’s a very, very – (inaudible) – that even a seller that can always recommend the importers in Mexico, they don’t do that because that’s (not ?) a problem. It’s also – it can be a problem by the seller don’t know, and then in one or two weeks, they’re being asked by customs, is this correct? \r\n In fact, the other example that you – that you can put – (inaudible) – Manuel, the next – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Slide? \r\n MR. PEÑA: – slide. (Inaudible) – this was a copy that we get from another – a company was audited from the Mexican customs because of value. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: The Mexican customs agency has some kind of power to go with American suppliers? \r\n MR. PEÑA: That’s a very good – (inaudible). There’s been now, like, eight to 10 years that Mexican customs and American customs share information. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Oh, okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: And this is part of the NAFTA treaty, but they do share information as much as – as Mexico has, like, five or six offices in the U.S., sharing information and backwards, in and out. Why is this? Because there were a lot of invoice that they didn’t cross into Mexico, that they stayed in your country. And by the other hand, there were a lot of merchandise that we were told it was certain kind of goods that they can from – (inaudible) – and there were another kind of goods that they were contraband. \r\n So if they find out that this will be helpful for both countries, they share a lot of information. So in this case, Manuel, when customs – and this was steel companies – steel has a lot of (problems ?). I – (inaudible) – connected, but when you talk about their production in “molino” – how do you say “molino” in English? \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: (Inaudible?) \r\n MS. : Mill? Mill? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Mill, yes. On their production mill, they say, well, this mill, it’s in the United States and – (inaudible) – wasn’t Ukraine or Russia or somewhere else. And then it’s very difficult for Mexican customs to know just by seeing – (inaudible) – goods – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: If they originate from there. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes, because it doesn’t – (inaudible) – made in this particular – (inaudible). So what they do, that they go ahead and tell American customs we’re going to audit this supplier in the U.S. And they go by this outsourced company – they go and they audit the supplier they use. And believe me, they are always working together. So you would receive a visit even from Mexican companies with an American authority – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: This is interesting to say – the Mexican government – (inaudible) – Mexican customs bureau has resources to go there, no? (Inaudible) – many companies who will start to – (inaudible) – into Mexico know that. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Not just that, Manuel. Mexican customs, even what you hear about them, they change a lot. What the – (inaudible) – that you hear or companies calling you that they have their merchandise stopped in the border, just think about this. Just 10 percent of the goods are being (revised ?). From those 10 percent, you get hundreds of calls every month. So imagine the other 90 that – it’s – (inaudible) – simple. It’s – (inaudible). \r\n So that’s why they share a lot of information so that they – as long as they don’t check the goods in that particular moment or in the future, those kinds of audits can happen pretty – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Oh, okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: You were talking about – when we talk about systems, customs – (inaudible) – systems so they know what you imported at what price, what description, what specification, how much you pay for duties. If you imported temporary – (inaudible) – to my – (inaudible) – in Mexico. If that material went out, if it didn’t went out. \r\n So you have all the information in the system that will go along and be shared with the American customs. And then they go together and go and – (inaudible) – supplier. And I have been participating (backwards ?) also. I remember American customs coming and (visiting ?) one of my customers in Mexico because they have some questions. (Inaudible.) I’m not talking about a document. They have their permit and all the legality support. The customer called me and said, can you – (inaudible) – with this? I – (inaudible) – the company with American customs. They think that this is terrible. Can you show me your manufacture process, where your raw materials come from, documents, or where you purchase your raw materials, if they qualify for NAFTA. \r\n So there’s a lot of information with this kind of – (inaudible). So you can get along with your – (inaudible) – importation once or twice, but sooner or later, if you’re – (inaudible) – supplier or you’re an importer in Mexico, they will catch you. Believe me. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. We move to the next one. And we are in the NAFTA (certification ?) of origins. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes, I mentioned this, Manuel, because it’s an important – very, very important factor, as you mentioned before, of paying or not paying duties. So when you send a NAFTA certificate, make sure that it’s filled out correctly with the complete export information – sometimes the producer, they lack a detailed description of the goods as well – address, zip code, company name, tax ID, signature is very important. \r\n A very important thing, Manuel, is that a NAFTA certificate for the importer of recorder in Mexico, he needs to have it in his file in original. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: This is important. \r\n MR. PEÑA: That’s very – even sellers can tell you how many times are they being asked for a NAFTA certificate in (origin). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: The Mexican importer. \r\n MR. PEÑA: The Mexican importer. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: This is – so – (inaudible) – if I’m going to purchase a company in the U.S. in exactly the same – the same characteristics of companies, I get in advance a company sending me without asking for them a monthly or a yearly NAFTA certificate in original form and importations – I really appreciate that, because their import-export clerk or manager is very busy with many things. When he finds out he cannot apply NAFTA from anything that already – that already is being imported in a year passed, and then I cannot apply for it. \r\n This is – I think this is very important to let them know – to all kind of companies in particular, the new ones for the market, the new ones for export, that this is on a – on a – I think an approach that’s in the document that they – (inaudible) – help Mexican importers to have everything in, you know, a file – (inaudible). And they could help them in a very simple way just sending this information. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes, it does make a difference. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: It does? \r\n MR. PEÑA: It does make the difference. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: It is important to know. Next, documentation. (Inaudible) – I think this is a key one. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes, very important. Unreadable commercial invoices – sometimes we’re getting invoices with writing, handwriting on it, descriptions only by – (inaudible) – number. You can never tell what’s the description of the goods. We mentioned it. \r\n Documents arrive after the material arrives – I always ask why we receive most of the invoices in the border with the goods, even after the goods arrive. (Inaudible) – coming from Chicago to Valero (sp), I’m driving at least three days, four days, according to the transportation company. Why can’t I – don’t get the documents in advance? \r\n And – (inaudible) – same questions 15 or 20 years after I started as a broker. And I don’t know if it’s that they send it to the importer of recorder or the importer doesn’t send them to us. I don’t know if it’s just – it’s just a common thing of doing it and saying, well, I won’t put it in an envelope and ship it with the merchandise. But that – in the past when you didn’t have Internet and attachments, well, I understand it’s just another expense. But now that you can advance that information easy, why – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: But who wants to require these documents? The Mexican importer, or is it a U.S. exporter who wants to send in advance to the customs broker – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well, I recommend that – even they’re – they are dealing with an importer of record in Mexico, if they can advance the documents so the custom broker that is going to work with the merchandise in the border, it’s a lot of help and makes a lot of difference as well. \r\n So that’s – those are the things that help us speed up an importation, because then – or a copy page – copy page from – on an email for the importer or record as well as the customs broker. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Because we can receive the documents in advance. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: I understand. (Inaudible) – \r\n MR. PEÑA: (Inaudible) – very, very (clear ?), but believe me, if you could see that invoice – (inaudible) – it will be – (inaudible) – you can see on the screen, it’s very difficult to know what is the merchandise – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQEUZ: Lack of description – (inaudible). Next. Again, just to be clear about these – (inaudible) – documentation. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Readable, clear, constant descriptions, unified part number, unit of measurements, quantity – in the packing list as well – readable descriptions, PAR number, quantity, weight, unit of measurement – all those – these – all these information is very helpful for us. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Could it be in Spanish or in English or – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. In English is fine, Manuel, as long as we have it. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n And you can add over a pre-alert, that he can put here when it’s short or over. Short – (inaudible) – or over – (inaudible). It will be very helpful as well that we can go and find out where’s the shortage instead of counting and making sure that the merchandise is – that it’s in the invoice, is the one that is coming to – (inaudible, cross talk) – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Oh, okay. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: – that we can match. \r\n MR. PEÑA: That’s a great point. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: We are in the – (inaudible) – number five, and I think this is one of the – with the custom broker, it’s very important to know that you’re going to work with a well-established customer base here, whether you have – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay, it’s been publicated (ph) and been a lot of advertisements that when you ship merchandise out of the United States, with a certain amount over a thousand dollars, I think or over $2,000, you are forced – it’s mandatory that you do a shipper’s export declaration. It is mandatory. It’s not something that you want to or not want. \r\n I can tell you something, Manuel. Many times, shipper’s export declarations are being done right now without people knowing that it’s being done. So every time a seller sends merchandise to Mexico, these documents is being filed through your customs systems. It’s like a validation process, and then it can cross the bridge. \r\n So now it’s just that I can know that each certain type of export entry – certain kind, not as a – how can I say that? – a formal – but it’s also a document that needs to be filed before your goods crossing from U.S. to Mexico. \r\n And this is – this is American authorities and we as forwarders need to go and attend an exam and pass and get on a conversation to be able to do a shipper’s export at origin. In fact, there’s fines in many things for avoiding doing a correct shipper’s exportation – export declaration. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: What about the people who send their products through the – I don’t know, a courier service: DHAL (sic), FedEx, or – \r\n MR. PEÑA: If the goods are over X amount of dollars, many of the times, the same couriers are doing it for us. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Oh, okay. Perfect. \r\n MR. PEÑA: But it’s under their name. Their name is being registered as being the exporter and the one sending from the U.S. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Oh, okay. It is – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Many times we have – because not knowing these requirements, we have negligence of the exporter regarding signature of POA. A POA is a power of attorney that we need. We need the power of attorney to file those – it’s like, people authorizing me to do shipper’s export declaration under their name. \r\n Delayed clearing of the shipment in the border without a power of attorney – I will never do an exportation. The merchandise will never get out of my warehouse in the border. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: I think that a good thing here or a special thing to say is that you could have – the American exporter could have several power of attorney, right? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: But if you work with several brokers or several forwarders – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. You can always – I don’t think there is a restriction on that – (inaudible, cross talk). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. This is good. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well, in each part of an implementation process, when we go and implement an importer in Mexico, we contact the sellers in the U.S., send them an e-mail presenting ourselves and telling them, you need to sign me this power of attorney. You need to do this. We’re going to be doing exportations under your name. \r\n And 50 or 60 percent of the time we have problems to get this POA each time because they don’t know that these are the restrictions. They think it’s about – (inaudible) – and others think that – (inaudible). It’s just missing information that people have. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay, well, like, you know this. We (are) going to talk about five mistakes. But we, when we start to talking about this, we find other – like, as a clue, we want to give you – \r\n MR. PEÑA: As a bonus. (Chuckles.) \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: As a bonus, I’m saying number six because we find out that it’s very important to let you know about this one. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Before that, I just want to mention that – what it says, that it’s an obligation to report all the material that will be exported to our country. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Yes, yes, yes, yes. It is important that they – \r\n MR. PEÑA: The next one is an example of power of attorney that deals – that is being dealt by the seller, by the people that is attending this webinar, they are the one responsible for dealing these kinds of power of attorney. \r\n And the next one is the shipper’s export declaration that we file with American system – with American customs. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. They receive these documents from the customer up there. Or – \r\n MR. PEÑA: We do it as a forwarding agency in U.S., other than we are for receiving goods. We can file it, not just – it can be done by an American broker; it can be done by a forwarder and even, I think, it can be done by a transportation company. But we need your authorization to be able to file shipper’s export declaration. \r\n And this is mistake number six. There was a big – there was a big issue about packaging recently, about the famous – (inaudible). And we will talk about it later. But it’s important to know that in the border, we are – we get material without labeling, many times without a part number, without description, so when you go into a verification of saying, this is the invoice, and you go ahead and look at the part, you can never tell which part is what and how can you do a verification of the good. \r\n So I always recommend you need to label it. Many times when it’s barcoded, we can always go and scan it and that’s a lot of help that we can put into our system as well. And label the shipment – suggestions: at the top of one of the piece – also, per carton – sometimes just comes the box and inside the box it’s a little box, and inside that little box, it’s more little boxes there. So all the information that can be labeled on the side can be – \r\n (Cross talk.) \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yeah, merchandise should be packed and marked, like part numbers. \r\n And also a good quality of packages is also – remember that when you talk about an importation into Mexico, you’re talking about many people that interfere in this. You’re talking about U.S. sellers, a transportation company that is – if it’s LTL or less than a truckload, it goes to several of these division centers. So it’s a transportation company, it’s a warehouse on the border, then it’s a trucking company in Mexico and then a final destination. \r\n So you’re talking about five or six times that that merchandise is being handled. If it’s inspected in customs, then you’re adding another layer over there. So a good packing is very important as well. (Audio break.) \r\n I just put an example there of discrepancies. Sometimes what fits in outside the packing, outside the box is not where it fits inside. So it’s fixing again, compact it, put on our carton, put on our label and doing that also within the border will be cost and will be time. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: And, arguably, I think that Mexican customs officers have to know, pointing out these kind of shipments because if you are having these discrepancies or mistakes, they want to point out that shipment. \r\n MR. PEÑA: That always happens when a – they start with the importer. They say, well, this importer record always have this – not liable information. And so the first thing they do is they start inspecting you more merchandise, so instead of the 10, you get to 15, 20 and it goes over. \r\n Or in the future, they can start again in presenting information and saying, can you go and check if particulars are there? Because it’s a common mistake that this happens. \r\n What I was talking about the wood pallets should be fumigated before shipping out the material. And this is – the three – (inaudible) – right now. They should be stamped with the official seal. And all the pallets should be fumigated in order to clear – it’s a known that it’s not – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: It’s just also in NAFTA. \r\n (Cross talk.) \r\n MR. PEÑA: There’s a standard that needs to be accomplished. Also with timing and investing in money, I have always an inventory of pallets in my warehouse because I – this always happens. So between the shipping of 20 pallets, out of those 20, five or 10 will be missing this. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: But who needs to inform to the exporter that they require this kind of pallets? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Manuel, if they’re sending it to Mexico, they need it. Okay? So they need this particular stamped, fumigated pallet. It’s a must. It’s a must. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Plastic does not have these requirements. Plastic pallet, it’s important to note, does not have these kind of requirements, even though it’s a lot more expensive. But you’re right; they don’t have these requirements. \r\n MR. PEÑA: It’s just for the – (inaudible); the wood for the – (inaudible). That’s why it’s – even though it’s not for carpeting; it’s just for wood. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: In this case, if they are the more popular – the wood is the more popular pallet to introduce – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Ninety-five percent of the goods are being exported in wood, unfortunately, because of the – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Yeah. Okay. We have here, one of the – like, the summary of all these mistakes and suggestions. \r\n In, like, your knowledge, the custom broker has to have a special card to work with you. If you don’t have a well-known and trustful (ph) custom broker to work with, you’re going to have a lot of problems. And this is why we suggest to you that you need to work with us on a very well-known custom broker that know the Mexican side and the U.S. side. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. Most of the mistakes, as I say, can be avoid (ph). And if you really trust that the guy that receives this merchandise on the border, it’s a professional company with professional people that work over there, that they help you, they really help you, you can always get good advice every time you ship your goods. \r\n And even we get audited by some of our customers in our warehouses. And they – we always learn from them. They teach us many things. And they always learn from us and say, if you go and do this, you can spend less time in the border for crossing your goods. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: So the must-dos that I put here – well, I recommend that you know your Mexican client, not just sell them and that’s it. \r\n Ask your custom broker for our specifications – very important. As I mentioned, you can always have a card specification before getting to the border. For – (inaudible) – classifications and pictures, Web links, catalogs – many information that can be done in advance, telling to clients the terms of responsibility, who pay the freight – (inaudible) – conditions, equal terms that is probably part of many, many mistakes. Those FOBs, equal terms applied in the border, at least in coming in trucks, shouldn’t be light. In at least 70 percent of the invoices come with FOB. They just apply for ocean – (coughs) – for those kinds of mistakes. \r\n And you know, here, I think it’s important to know that we’re dealing with the equal terms of the responsibility. It is part of the door-to-door activity, you know, from the U.S. company and the Mexican because if the Mexicans say, no, I want that you provide me, you know, send me the shipment in my door, I think they could do working with a custom broker who has that experience to, you know, to – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yet, if it could make the difference, Manuel, and you need to send your goods – (inaudible) – in a particular company, Mexico probably is just a physical person or is just a person at a small company, there’s always a legal way of doing it correctly because there needs to be an importer record and then that importer record needs to supply that company. So everything has to be documented correctly. And it has to be, in an accounting term, very well-filed for getting the goods. \r\n (Inaudible) – then after the certificate will always help you send – sell your merchandise in Mexico, you qualify for NAFTA, obviously. Same idea with a copy of documents required: the invoice and packing list. But remember to send it in advance. (Inaudible) – more – (inaudible) – if you send it in advance. \r\n Send documents to custom broker before the material arrives at the border. Again, power of attorney, NAFTA – believe me – many times we receive the goods over there, we didn’t even know who was the supplier and we need to start from zero when we receive a good from a – \r\n Get the power of attorney, get a NAFTA certificate, get an invoice so if they – if I am an importer record in Mexico and I’m already buying from a company in the U.S., that company in the U.S. has the document – the proper document, he could be advancing those documents to that particular forwarder in the border. And the reason that he’ll be surprised, saying, well, I received this – I received this seller because he’s advancing me a lot of information that will help me before the goods arrive to the border. \r\n Label each package with the correct part number. We mention it. And the wooden pallet should be fumigated as well. And, believe me, if these most two things are being done by you, I guarantee you that 80 or 90 percent can be speed up very, very much regarding the importation – (inaudible). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: It’s important to know that every product has their own mind. No, I think you need to – have to know that for each different import – textiles, to import steel, to import food – and I think this is why it’s important that you know that there’s some kind of flexibilities here. \r\n MR. PEÑA: You’re right, Manuel. Regarding each sector, even chemicals have their own – their own life – (chuckles) – I can tell you. Metals, produce, even raw materials itself – (inaudible – importations in Mexico to manufacture. So all these kinds of importations can be worked as long as we have the support even with the importer or the seller. \r\n And many times, if the seller already made a commitment to send a company – that happens a lot as well, Manuel, that a seller made a commitment on sending the merchandise to Mexico City, to Guadalajara, to Monterrey. So the buyer is waiting for these goods – (inaudible) – so he – take into account that you will do everything for him. \r\n So that’s why these – it’s not good to be negotiated – you negotiated for being a deal with the importer since you start making the – (inaudible) – in Mexico. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. Well, thank you very much, Rafael. I think it’s time for the questions now. If you have any questions? \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Operator, please open the line for Q\u0026amp;A. \r\n OPERATOR: Thank you. (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: And we already have a few questions that I’ll go ahead and ask our speakers. And somebody wants to know what do you mean by “unusable commercial invoice”? Please give more detailed information. What is “unusable”? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. When you send an invoice with – can we go to slide number 11?  \r\n When we send an invoice that it’s not clear on what it comes in the shipment – that one, yes, thank you, Manuel – this is not usable for me for being imported. So what we do physically is that we go on the back of the invoice and we type the description, the value because this is an official document, right? It will be a document that can be revised or checked in an inspection in customs. In fact, you leave a complete file in customs for the future, well – (inaudible) – or whatever. \r\n So what we meant by this is that when you do a correct description of part, number, goods, unit price in the invoice, these invoices are the ones used for the importation. We need – we don’t need to retype it or to put – in fact, it’s just like a protect of the invoice. \r\n When you type it and you need to sign, a responsible thing – I am protecting this invoice because it wasn’t clear in time for it. So in case there is a problem in customs, you are responsible for protecting that invoice. It usually means that, well, this information is probably mostly about the same, so that’s why we really appreciate when we have complete information in the invoice. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Do we have any questions, Operator? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes, thank you. Our first question from the phones is from Jeannette (sp). \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Okay. \r\n Q: Yes, I actually have two questions. I’m unclear as to who does the power of attorney. Is it the seller? Is it the broker? Is it the forwarding company? Who actually does the power of attorney? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay, for shipper export declaration, sending your goods into Mexico, for the U.S. purpose for U.S. customs, the seller does the power of attorney. And I’m talking about for shipwreck, for – \r\n For importing goods in Mexico, there’s a power of attorney as well that we need to get from the importer in Mexico. So one is done by the seller to be the exportation from your country to Mexico. And the other one is done – is being done by the importer. \r\n I didn’t mention this in the presentation because that’s something that we get. It’s an authorization to do importations under the name of the importer record in Mexico. So your question was for the shipper export declaration in U.S. – it’s you as the seller. \r\n Q: And is there an online document that you can download so that – for the power of attorney? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well, in the presentation, there’s a sample. \r\n Q: So you can make one off of that sample? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes. Yes. They’re going to have the presentation? \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Yes. You will have the presentation. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yeah. You will be receiving this presentation, Jeannette (ph). \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: In fact, if you need to e-mail me so I can send you a format as well, no problem. \r\n Q: Okay. And then my other question is, how do you find a good company, whether it’s the custom brokers or the forwarder? Because I had one experience where – I’ve only shipped into Mexico once – and I had the forwarding company online with my sales representative from Mexico and the LTL carrier. And not once did the forwarding company tell me that he could also do the brokerage end of it. \r\n So when my Mexican sales rep found a broker, they were in two different warehouses. And I had all the documents sent to everybody prior to. And when it got down to the forwarding agent, then the broker said, well, why is it there? Why didn’t it come here? And it fell apart when it hit the border. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: In that case, we have on a contact list with several customs brokers that we could share with you. Obviously, we met before with these companies. They are very reliable. But you need to check to – we have on a – there’s on our website that you could see the record of these companies and how they are, you know, doing the visas here in Mexico. \r\n I don’t know what – could you comment about that, Rafael? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well Manuel, to be honest, it depends on who’s paying for the services. If the importer records in Mexico is the one – is the one responsible for getting his goods into Mexico, he’ll be the ones that are telling you, send it to these particular brokers. It’s your responsibility to leave – to put your merchandise into Mexico in the door of the buyer. \r\n Q: On the LTL carrier? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well, you need to find – while it’s many companies and travel companies, or somebody that could do that importation to Mexico. Now, if your commitment is getting your goods into Mexico, remember, visas do not work like in the U.S. that you can have a bond as an American company and import into Mexico. It is a very different scenario. In Mexico, you need to be a legal, established company with your importer records filed and authorized by the Mexican government. So you need to find the correct ways of getting that particular, how do you say – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Trading company. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Trading company to import it, and then getting it into your customer. \r\n Q: So if I e-mailed you, you could send me the website with the list of companies? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Yes, of course. \r\n Q: Okay. Okay. All right, thank you. \r\n MR. PEÑA: You’re welcome. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Operator, any other questions? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes. Your next question comes from Elsa Robinson (ph). \r\n Q: I just had one question on the packing list where you listed that you need to put the weight. Is it the net and gross weight, or do you just need the gross weight? \r\n MR. PEÑA: It’s appreciable. We really appreciate that you put both but gross weight is fine. And not – and I tell you this because even in Mexican customs as well as in American customs, they have the big weight stations that when they have weights that’s in loads, I don’t trust that these particular merchandise that they viewed it upon the weight that’s more difficult. It weighs that – the amount that they (are coming in ?). So gross weight, it’s enough. But we really appreciate it if you could put both. \r\n Q: In the U.S., you have to put the net and the gross on the packing list when you’re importing because customs also looks at the weight of the unit to also verify, you know, the product. Because if you’re bringing in nails, you know, a nail should only weigh one – you know, like 1/10 of a pound. And they compare that to the shipment. So that’s why I asked. Is it net and growth? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. If the product pays duty upon weight, you need to put both, you’re right. But if you’re talking about a machine, that it pays for its own particular HTF or – (inaudible) – specification, and the weight is not so important. We can put a gross weight with no problem. \r\n Q: Thank you. \r\n MR. PEÑA: You’re welcome. Operator, other questions? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes. Your next question comes from Eliza Herrera (ph). \r\n Q: I’m sorry. That was a power-of-attorney, and I got the answer. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. \r\n Q: Yeah. \r\n OPERATOR: Okay. And then we have a question from Alberto Diaz. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Alberto Diaz. \r\n Q: Yes, Alberto Diaz. Listen, in case of an audit from customs, either U.S. or Mexican, on the certificate of origin or the NAFTA certificate, who is ultimately responsible for that information? \r\n MR. PEÑA: The one – that issue, the NAFTA certificate – if you as the seller were the one issuing the NAFTA certificate, you are responsible, Alberto. And even if you are producer and you can show that you are the producer and your production lines or procedures, or you have the support from who you purchased the merchandise from, you can – you can always tell that it’s an origin product. But you are the one responsible if you issue the certificate of origin. \r\n What is important as well, Alberto, is that if somebody in Mexico, they use your letterhead or your NAFTA certificate or a copy, and they were the ones that did that NAFTA certificate under your name, you have – you just need to prove that that happened because I’m sorry to say this, but those things happen – (inaudible) – it’s very common. \r\n Q: Okay, thank you. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: On that certificate question, can I give a NAFTA certificate if the equipment is made in Germany but repaired in the U.S.? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. The origin never changes. If you tell me that you’re going to transform a complete transformation of a good, that’s different. So you – we need to go back to the rules of origin. But the origin of the goods never change. And even that’s important. If we import – and I have a company that imports little microphones to do these phones, and they import from Japan, and they import from Japan through U.S., and they pay the duties for U.S., then when they come to you, to Mexico, they need to pay again the duties because the origin is never – is never lost. \r\n So what I recommend is you bring it in – (inaudible) – in the U.S., and let’s import it so you just pay once for the goods. When you go back, we need to go to the rules of origin to make sure that that phone plug qualifies now as a Mexican product, because the microphone is just a little part. But it is – it is important also that the origin is the correct one. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Operator? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes. At this time, there are no further questions. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: I have a few more. Rafael, does the seller ship the goods directly to the broker? Or why do you say that you receive materials without knowing who the seller is? \r\n MR. PEÑA: The shipper or the seller sends materials typically direct to the broker. What I mean by the broker is to be a warehouse in any border – let’s talk about your south border, any border. So we receive a lot of materials knowing – without knowing who the importer is; sometimes just with a packing slip, with a packing slip saying this XYZ company in the U.S. is sending this particular merchandise to my forwarding agency. It arrives at my warehouse and I don’t know even the seller, and I don’t know who the buyer is in Mexico. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: Or it could be the other side. You know, you’re being contracted by a – by a Mexican company, and the Mexican company asks you, and you don’t know where is – which is the American seller, or you could know. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Sometimes, Manuel, as long as we know that it’s regular cargo, we accept the goods and then get further notice: Two weeks after, then somebody calls you, oh, and by the way, I sent you this merchandise, and I was – I’m going to sell it to this particular company into Mexico. So that particular information can be done in advance, a pre-alert saying, I’m sending you these goods for this importer in Mexico; I’ll send my shipment, or contact these companies in Mexico, so you can do all your work. Or that particular company in Mexico, that they are expecting it from our company. They know the procedures, but he never told me that he was expecting some goods a week after we authorized it in our system. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Okay. Another certificate question: Can I create my own NAFTA certificate? And if so, what information should I include? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay, did we include – no, we didn’t include the example. Mark (ph), can we send – \r\n MR. : Yes. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. We will send a NAFTA sample. It’s very easy to fill it out. And in case you have questions, please e-mail us. But even we can send it with the instructions of how to fill it out. I think it would be better for them to have the format and the instructions how to fill it out. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: And also, you could always visit www.export.gov and click on the website for information on tariffs, whether it be classification, et cetera. And we’re also – the Department of Commerce is only a phone call away, by calling 1-800-US-TRADE. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: And we have the market research. We have all the research into this. At the Commercial Service, we do provide on market research, we – these kind of topics that can help you directly to make the export more successfully. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Another question that we have is, if a shipment is held up at the border by customs and is impounded, what are the options available to help secure the release of the shipment? \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. And I think Manuel gets a lot of calls on this matter. If the – if the product gets held at customs, it’s because it’s already a legal procedure. Depends on what kind of fine, but typically when it’s stopped at customs and they hold it, even – they’re taking information, is the example I made, or they are already making that a legal procedure to keep the goods for – because that’s the fine that they got. \r\n Let’s talk about when they have over-merchandise. If it doesn’t exceed 10 percent of over-merchandise, you pay the fine and you get your goods. If you’re (not scared ?) at all, and if it exceeds – even if it’s a totally different product of what you declared, then you get your merchandise fined, you know, 100 percent. You don’t get your goods back. Even, you pay your fine, and then those goods, they go in to be part of the government. Then they do – retail it, or they do other things with it. \r\n But that’s why we need to be very careful before answering. You know, it depends on what kind of fine you are being involved in. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Thank you. Operator, can you repeat the procedures for making a phone – for opening the phones? \r\n OPERATOR: (Gives queuing instructions.) One moment, please, for the first question. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Well, I’ll keep asking questions. Is my company liable if the Mexican importer alters the value of the merchandise? \r\n MR. PEÑA: As long as you can prove that you were not the one altering that value of the goods, you will always (sic) be liable. But that needs to be proven in a legal procedure. I recommend – I need to – I need to recommend that it is better not to sell to a company that fixes the goods, the value of the goods, because he will always be in some kind of trouble. And by the other hand, it can be, as well, your trouble, or at least getting audited. You have no need for that. \r\n So as long as you’re selling to somebody that he fixes his invoices, you are not selling to a real – to a reliable company. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Perfect. Operator, any questions? \r\n OPERATOR: Our first question comes from Jeanette (ph). Your line is open. \r\n Q: Yes, one more question concerning the NAFTA. Where do you find out if your product qualifies as a NAFTA – \r\n MR. PEÑA: Okay. Jeanette, this is – this is – this comes with the NAFTA rules of origin. It’s a complete – “un tema separado” – \r\n MR. : (Off mic) – \r\n MR. PEÑA: It’s a separate topic, Jeanette. But you send your request very – I can send you what are the rules of origin to Mexico – try to send them – because they are long, and they are sometimes not very understandable. But it’s by value, by where the contents, the hand labor that is done. So there’s many, many ways of classifying that as NAFTA, if it does classify. \r\n MR. : And who will certify you as a NAFTA product – \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: No, not normally. That certificate is just under your responsibility, as long as you can prove you are qualifying those NAFTA rules. So there’s a specific topic, Laura, that – Jeanette, that you – that you need to make sure you qualify for NAFTA. If there’s a product in particular you want to send it from the USA, well, this is in the contents, this is my product, these raw materials are made here, this – or made there, my hand labor is this percent. We can always as well help you with that. \r\n Q: Okay, thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: Our next question comes from Holentino (ph). Your line is open. \r\n Q: Hello, this is Tino. You’ve gone through a couple of scenarios that I have often come up with, which is, I am a distributor of equipment, industrial equipment. And most of my customers are in Mexico. And in doing so, I have to go out and request calls from vendors. They could be manufacturers, and also distributers for manufacturers. And I always request, you know, the quote, and request from them if they could provide a NAFTA certificate of origin or the information to fill out a NAFTA certificate of origin. And they always tell me, yes, they can, or they’ll tell me, no, we can’t. \r\n But when the products arrive at the border, they tell me they cannot provide it, contradicting what they said before. And sometimes not only that, but sometimes the product is made in China instead of the United States. What do you do in situations like that? Or who’s – I know I am – I’m responsible for filling out the certificate of origin, but what do you do in cases like that? \r\n MR. PEÑA: You are located in United States, right? \r\n Q: Yes, I am. \r\n MR. PEÑA: The questions you will be – that you’re re-selling the goods? \r\n Q: Yeah, I’m re-selling the goods. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Re-selling. \r\n Q: Yeah. \r\n MR. PEÑA: In that particular case, you are a distributor of somebody that will not issue a certificate of origin, then you cannot issue it. You cannot do a certificate of origin as well. \r\n Q: Yeah, but you – what do you do when you already bought the goods, they already told you they would provide you a certificate, and suddenly, when the product is already here, then they tell you it’s not? \r\n MR. PEÑA: That’s also very common. You know, but my recommendation is to – you need – well, I don’t know how much you know the companies you distribute for, but I think it’s more – it’s more important for them to sell rather than anything else, you know, because it’s a big thing. Yes, you’re right, we have many examples that we can – merchandise in the border we cannot process; nobody wants to issue the certificate of origin. And then, instead of paying zero, it goes to 20 or 25 or 30 percent. \r\n Q: That’s what it ends to, right? Because that’s what – that’s what’s been my experience. I get a product – let’s say, just to put an example, a name of a company “X,” and they even issue me a NAFTA certificate where they – it’s a general NAFTA certificate where they list all their equipment that they sell. So I have to go and pick the one that I bought from them and put it on my NAFTA certificate. But then when the product gets here, it’s made in China. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Well, that’s the commercial side as well. But I think – well, it can be – it can be two things. I can (rely ?) on not knowing what they’re doing. And – (inaudible) – doing it on purpose, and saying, well, I’m going to issue it anyway. And that – believe me, in the border, it happens a lot. We get a NAFTA certificate, we go physically to the goods, and they say China or they say somewhere else. \r\n But that’s the commercial side between you and who sell it to you, because regarding border, you cross it, you will have a problem on the border. \r\n Q: Yeah. It’s a commercial what? \r\n MR. PEÑA: It’s a commercial issue that the – \r\n Q: Yeah, okay. \r\n MR. PEÑA: It’s a commercial deal. It’s not something that legally you can do against them. Just they’re telling you something, they shouldn’t be issuing you a certificate. The best thing here that they don’t – they don’t tell you on their – until they sell it to you. \r\n Q: Okay. No, I know – I know where some of the companies that I deal with, they take note, and then they correct. But some of them just keep on doing the same thing. So I have to go tell my customer, hey, I’m sorry, it’s made in China. You have to pay your duty first. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Is this the same – is it the same as the other – as the other case, that they give you a NAFTA certificate for something that is not from the NAFTA zone, that’s not – (inaudible)? So even if it’s not very well if you go and physically tell that the merchandise is from China, even though they’re very good guys with you and they give it to you, well, it’s not – it’s not correct – the same way. \r\n Q: Yeah, that situation happens with people that want to export, but they don’t know where the product comes from, and they still do a NAFTA certificate and it’s not made in the United States, and – but they – but they give it to you. Then you give it to your – (inaudible) – order. And then, they go, sorry, this came in with something that says here, “Made in Germany.” Then you’re in trouble. \r\n MR. PEÑA: I’ll recommend you something: Get this presentation – get this presentation and send it to them. (Laughter.) (Inaudible.) \r\n Q: Yeah. No, no. I tell them that – you guys are – you don’t know what you’re doing. You’re not supposed to issue a NAFTA certificate if it’s not made in the NAFTA region zone. And I get with them – just yesterday, I had a big case, because I bought a $3,000 furnace and the guys didn’t want to issue a NAFTA certificate. But they said on the phone, we will provide a NAFTA certificate upon purchase. So here I am, stuck with the furnace, because they don’t want to provide it. \r\n MR. PEÑA: Ow. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: And unfortunately, that is not uncommon. \r\n Q: It’s not. No. \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Well, Rafael, Manuel, thank you so much for a comprehensive and tactical presentation. If anyone in the audience still has any questions, feel free to e-mail Manuel, myself or Rafael. \r\n MR. VELAZQUEZ: The information there – \r\n MS. GIMENEZ: Everyone in the presentation – in the – in the webinar will be receiving the recorded presentation, as well as the audio, in the next several days. \r\n Like Karen mentioned, the U.S. Commercial Service, with over a hundred offices in the U.S. and 80 throughout U.S. embassies and consulates, can help your company increase sales to new markets. Our dedicated staff will help you get started to increase your sales internationally. We can help you by providing world-class market research, introduce you to qualified buyers and distributors, and counsel you on every step of the export process. \r\n If you are a new-to-export company, please take advantage of our 1-800-USA-TRADE phone number, where our dedicated staff can inform you about general exporting counseling, sources of international market research; again, give you insights on tariffs, classifications and so on.

Good morning and afternoon. My name is Delia Valdivia and I'm and International Trade Specialist for the U.S. Commercial Service and a team member of the Global Design and Construction team. Thank you everyone for participating in today's Webinar on the Chilean reconstruction opportunities. \r\n We are very excited to be able to provide this Webinar for you. We are fortunate to have excellent speakers that have generously offered to share their knowledge and expertise on the Chilean market and the opportunities available for U.S. companies. \r\n Before launching into the Webinar context, I would like to take a few minutes to mention the Commercial Service, the Global Design and Construction Team and introduce our speakers on the call. \r\n The U.S. Commercial Service is the trade promotion arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce International Trade Administration. We are located in over 100 U.S. cities and in 80 countries. We work with small and medium size companies in assisting them in increasing their sales in the international market. \r\n We are here to assist you in every stage of the export process. And here are just a couple of the different things that we do, global networking, market intelligence, trade counseling, business matchmaking and trade advocacy. \r\n Within the Department of Commerce the U.S. Commercial Service we have the global design and construction team, which is a group of industry focused staff that serve and support the U.S. design and construction industry with its international business development. Our mission is to increase the number of U.S. companies selling their products and services overseas. \r\n Team members and staff are located worldwide. Some of the services that the team and our staff provide are basically developing an international marketing strategy, obtaining market and industry research, identifying partners and reps for you to work with in international market, one to one counseling on international markets and the opportunity they hold. And if you need something to be customized, we can do that as well. \r\n Please take a time to visit our team Web site at www.export.gov\\industry\\architecture\\index.asp or the one on construction, which is just below. \r\n And now for our speakers. We will have discussing opportunities on the (earthquick) reconstruction update we will have Matthew Hilgendorf and Marcello Orellana. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf is a Commercial Officer with the U.S. Commercial Service.

With that, we will start our program with Matthew and Marcello. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Thank you Delia. Good morning and good afternoon everybody. This is Matthew Hilgendorf, Commercial Officer with the Commercial Service stationed here at the Embassy in Santiago. I have with me today Commercial Specialist Marcello Orellana and we're going to take the next 15 minutes to describe what has happened here and what is happening in terms of rebuild and how we can support you. \r\n Also by the way, for those of you who have been to U.S. Commerce offices outside the U.S. we're the commercial section in the embassy and our jobs is to help U.S. exporters of products or services to sell outside the U.S. and we're here to serve you. Next slide please. \r\n Overview. Very quickly we're going to cover these five items just so that you see what we're going to talk about epicenter, demographic information, damages, Chilean Government actions and response, private sector involvement and opportunities. Next slide please. \r\n As many of you know, Chile is one of the most interesting countries in the world in terms of its geography. It is extremely long and thin, just 100 miles on average, diverse climates and geography. Right now we've got a full on winter with snow in the mountains and below freezing temperatures in the morning. The opposite season for the U.S. as most of you know. \r\n Seventeen million population makes it a relatively small country but it is a country with a high level of development and a high amount of consumer buying power. \r\n I mean the point is here that this earthquake hit the center of the country where the population is concentrated. We estimate about 75% of the population was affected. Closest to the epicenter is the city Concepcion, a large seaport in the heart of wood and paper industry. Population of the greater Concepcion area is about two million people. Coal, steel and petro chemical industries are also present there. \r\n A note on Chile. Chile has always been reconstructing. It's a country that suffers and earthquake of this size about every 25 years. And in between there are less severe ones that cause significant damage too. So it may be incredible but they're still reconstructing from the previous one. \r\n I just read yesterday a hospital in (Sopapilla), a city North of Santiago, is about to inaugurate its newest hospital; one that was severely damaged in a 2008 earthquake that most of us didn't even remember. This is a country used to reconstructing and it's a way of life. Next slide please. \r\n Damages and costs. These are dramatic photos; these are not invented; these are real photos. The total cost of the damage and lost production is estimated at $30 billion, which is about 17% of GDP. So a huge economic hit. But however, Chile's going to get a huge economic injection in terms of government spending and the tension on reconstructing. So we expect that despite the hit to the GDP, things will be just fine economically. \r\n They talk about in terms of infrastructure as many of 221 bridges were damaged or destroyed, highways almost 1000 miles and a lot of infrastructure in the area of Concepcion both in terms of the ports and then the canal are also going to need repair. \r\n Schools, as many as 3000; the number of students over a million and hospitals 60 damaged and 15 destroyed completely. Homes, the estimate is about 370,000 homes either damaged or destroyed. Again, not all these were damaged; some were just destroyed and some (exactly). \r\n The Chilean - next one thank you. The Chilean Government response. Emergency care was provided and was successful and Chile thanks to the international community has recovered very well. With the winter coming on that is back in May there was a need to really put roofs over peoples heads and make sure that they were safe and, you know, all their basic needs taking care of and this was accomplished quite well. \r\n In fact it's kind of a fun bit of trivia but the first World Cup game, soccer World Cup game that Chile played, the idea was that everybody would be under a roof and somewhat comfortable in order to see that game because it was such a big deal and they accomplished it. \r\n It's worth noting that a special exception to Chile's procurement or concession procedure has expired. There was a time in the very beginning when in order to get the relief out quickly, Chile officials and others could make purchases quickly and without going through the normal sort of fairly complicated and involved rules. \r\n And that's now been - given that things that have been accomplished, they are no longer requiring - they're now going to go back to their system, which is a well designed system and that we'll talk about in terms of concessions and procuring. And construction is supposed to last about four years unless there's another earthquake to create yet another reconstruction plan. Next one please. \r\n So this is our best and we put a lot of effort into this. We've had several people working on this year to date around the table. And we've been working hard on this to understand where the opportunities are for you the companies because it seems to me with this call the main question you want to ask - have answered is whether there's an opportunity for you in Chile and how tell you should proceed. \r\n And the truth is that a lot of the infrastructure has been taken care of, immediate needs were taken care of, couple of bridges that were totally destroyed have been put up in a temporary way. And many others that were just damaged have been at least rehabilitated such that they are safe to use at least for now and now they're taking inventory on what exactly they're going to do. \r\n We've noted you see here five projects that are under way that will be, you know, bid. They're asking for bids, they're asking for companies to bid on these. And these don't necessarily have to do with the reconstruction but I wanted to put them up here because they illustrate that Chile is continuing on with a general infrastructure investment plan. \r\n And something else I want you to take away from this presentation is Chile is not putting on hold anything else that it had planned. I mean the reconstruction from the earthquake is an issue but it doesn't change their overall plan and we understand that plan well and I've just listed the first five projects. Every year there are about another five projects of similar value of different kinds that we're going to be tracking so make sure that you stay in contact with us so that we can help you get into those projects. \r\n Housing is ongoing. We estimate that there are - well, just recently 253,000 families applied for government funds to either repair or completely rebuild their house. About half of them lost their house completely and the other half had them severely - their houses severely damaged. So that's 253,000 families, that's 253,000 homes that are going to need to be built. \r\n The price that they'll get in terms of subsidy from the government is not huge and it will not create - build houses of the kind that we might be used to in the U.S. These are going to be maybe only 15,000, $20,000 housing subsidies. So as you think of selling into Chile think of building materials that are cost effective and easy to manage and that could fit into a very much of a lower price range. \r\n Hospitals. Hospitals and schools I've read now have been - they're going to be rebuilt to withstand a 9.0 earthquake and which is a high standard that probably anyone has attempted in the world. Keep in mind that as we look at that. \r\n The government has announced plans to construct 12 hospitals but we're putting on here a holding pattern because we don't see that the tendering process has begun yet. But again, this is the kind of thing that we track and if you have any interest in that particular type of construction, we'll help you stay in contact with us on that. Next slide please. \r\n Private sector involvement. Rebuild Chile 2010 - June 2010 trade show was a success. We were involved and I'll let Peter talk more about that and the upcoming show. Our office is in contact with private firms like those on this phone - on this call and others determining needs and looking for ways for you to get into the business here via contracts or selling products or service. \r\n Another thing on this slide, some of the companies that we know that will be involved - that are involved in construction and engineering in this country and it will continue to be. And I put them up there because these are the kinds of companies we can help you make contacts with. And we want to emphasize that in a country like Chile it's extremely important to make, you know, partnerships or go into partnerships with a local firm. It will make everything easier and we'll talk a little bit more about that. And our next slide please. \r\n So opportunities for U.S. companies. I don't need to tell you this. I'm going to put it up only because I wouldn't want to leave anybody out. But there are companies that could be subcontractors, there are those who could be suppliers and there even those that could possibly win contracts directly from the government. \r\n But essentially Chile needs, and I'm going to say need although it's clear that Chile is a very self-sufficient country. And Chile when it comes to earthquake they've rebuilt so many times that they don't - they've had to go it alone a lot of the time and they will continue too. And so what is needed? \r\n Everything is needed. I didn't put everything. I can't list it all. I wanted to focus on four here that we think are particularly good opportunities but it's by no means all that there is. Please don't consider this the end - the final list. \r\n But I will note that energy efficiency technology is important, gas, oil. Sorry, power prices is a very high in Chile and anything that can use renewable energy or that will simply create energy savings in new construction I think should be very, very attractive to Chileans today. \r\n Machinery and equipment of all kinds, earth moving so on especially building materials. Chile is a wood producer so, you know, when it comes to wood, Chile is, you know, quite strong but there maybe a lot of other types of materials that U.S. companies can provide that would bring, you know, sort of an added value to their construction. \r\n There are success stories. In interest of time, I will skip over the discussion of one but our job in this office is to create success. We don't get much credit for just running Webinars. We actually want you to make sales. And when you make a sale, we know we've had success. So we - I'm less concerned with success stories that have been and more concerned with ones that we can create for you going forward. Next slide please. \r\n So opportunities for U.S. companies. I'm not going to get into details here. We're going to talk - if our lawyers are on the line the ones who signed up for this conference and they will talk about this. Otherwise I will have Marcello Orellana talk. \r\n But, you know, with any foreign markets there can several channels that you can use. You can go into partnership. You can go it alone. You can only sell product or service and you can choose to open an office, not open an office. We know all the variations and there's so many different kinds of companies on the line today it would be crazy to try to, you know, talk about any one of those. But we should know that we know there are different ways and our job is to help you find the channel. \r\n We're going to talk a little bit about the Chile (compress) site, which is an online procurement site and Chile is transparent. The country has got clear rules and it's highly competitive which is the downside but it's highly transparent which is the upside of that. \r\n And again, I'd like to leave you with a note that we encourage you strongly to partner with people and that's exactly where we come in is we help you find the appropriate partner. One that compliments what you can do and will give you, you know, an inside track into doing business. So next slide is the last slide. \r\n I want to thank everybody for being on the call. I tried to cover as much as I could in the short amount of time in the interest of hopefully leaving plenty of times for questions and answers where most of, you know, sort of the good exchange can occur. At this point I'd like to find out of the lawyer (Carolina) is on the line. If not, then I would like Marcello to quickly cover her few slides that we have coming up next. Thank you everybody. \r\n Coordinator: (Carolina), your line is open. \r\n (Carolina Gonya): Thank you. And well, it's time for me to talk about - well, first of all I would - I'd like to introduce myself. I'm (Carolina Gonya). I'm a corporate lawyer that works for a local firm with plenty of experience in telecom process and the concession of (private works). And today I'm here to make an introduction - a briefly introduction of the concept before mentioned related with two different procedures to make this (unintelligible). \r\n One of them is telecom for process. This procedure is used to sell to the government. And it is secured through a transactional platform called (telecompra). That is the place where the government publishes its needs for goods and services. And the only way to access to this platform is through a (geester) with (telecompra) and (unintelligible) where you have to confirm legal entity stages and the most straight your financial situation and technical (unintelligible). \r\n To operate through the platform, it's not a simple procedure and requires local assistance. But the scope - to be more specific, the scope of these procedures extends to all contracts subscribed by the government for the supply of all the goods and services it requires for expansion and applies to national and foreign companies. \r\n According to the procurement procedure that's established by law and are the following. Public meeting, private tender, direct contract and framework contract. The second - next please. Okay. \r\n Regarding to the concession program, this is the second concept and is related to the construction, maintenance and operation of public infrastructure in field such as airports, bridges, prisons, roads and hospitals. This system is based on the indirect provision of public goods and services through private sector involvement. \r\n Management is delivered to the private (unintelligible) the financial risk in exchange for the right to charge a user fee. These contracts are (BOT) or (DBOT) and both systems involve the private sector participation in the design, construction and operation of public works so that once the concession period ends or expires, the contractor that delivered the work is in the best position to re-tender. \r\n In relations with the scope, the concession law applies as the slide shows to all public works and that means bridges what I have already tell and domestic and foreign firms or companies that maybe both can be Chilean or foreign as well. \r\n Finally, I will say that work procedure is made through competitive bidding, national or international. That's the end. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Thank you (Carolina). Now Peter, we can have you. \r\n Peter McKenna Okay. Hi. Can you - am I live now? \r\n Delia Valdivia: You're live. \r\n Peter McKenna Okay. Thank you all for the opportunity to talk to you about the Expo Rebuild Chile that's taking place in Concepcion in October. I thought what - if you could advance the slide please. \r\n What I thought I would talk about today just briefly give you a little bit of background about our company, Coleman Worldwide and zero in a little bit on the specific experience that we have had in Chile over the years, give you a summary of what happened at our first edition of the Rebuild Chile Expo that we held in Santiago in June and then talk a bit about what we're planning to do now for the second edition of the show that'll be taking place in October. And then I'm certainly here to answer any questions and - or concerns that you might have. Next slide please. \r\n Coleman Worldwide was founded in 1963 as a company specifically involved in bringing U.S. groups of companies into trade shows all over the world. We've worked on nearly 750 different shows literally on every continent and worked directly with 10,000 individual companies during the course of those years, many of which have been new to market. Next slide please. \r\n Now in terms of Chile, we first got involved in that market in 1994 organizing the U.S. group at an aerospace event called (FEDI) which takes place every two years. We then got involved in a mining show called Expomin, a naval show called Exponaval and most recently an event that was just a showcase of U.S. products called Trade One and the U.S. was the featured country there. Next slide please. \r\n But it was as we were getting ready for (FEDI) 2010 that just less than a month before that show opened that the terrible earthquake and tsunami of February 27 hit and, you know, our first concerns of course were with the staff and friends that we have in Chile. But after that we wondered whether the show would continue on in Santiago or not. \r\n And a lot of meeting were held, a lot of decisions made where the Chilean Government decided that despite the massive problems that they were suffering that they also wanted to send a signal that Chile remained open for business and was capable of dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake. \r\n And so barely three weeks after that catastrophe, they hosted a large group of international companies at the (FEDI) show of which the United States was the largest country participating. Next slide please. \r\n And it was during that show that our President (Tom Coleman) met with the President of Chile, Sebastian Pinera who had just been - or sworn into office literally the week before that event. And the President was very, very pleased with the support that he was seeing from the U.S. companies that participated at (FEDI). \r\n And during the conversation with (Tom) there, they began to lay the seeds for having a U.S. solo show where U.S. companies that are involved in any of the products and services that Chile would need for the reconstruction effort would come to Chile and showcase those products. \r\n And that was followed by a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Gary Locke in Washington with (Tom) and the President and a number of business leaders. And the idea and the format of the show in June was launched. Next slide please. \r\n That show - I must say the very, very highly supported by the embassy in Santiago led by then Ambassador Simons who has subsequently moved on. But the Ambassador and the full commercial service staff there and all of their colleagues really rolled up their sleeves and put a lot of effort into the show making certain that not only the right U.S. companies were informed about it but also that the right Chilean visitors came. \r\n And in these photos you're seeing that we had the Minister of Foreign Affairs actually open the show but we also had the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Energy, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Environmental Affairs all came through and toured the event. But crucially important were the people that you're seeing in that bottom left picture, the intendentes from the three regions that were most severely impacted by the earthquake. \r\n And Chile is divided into regions and three of them in particular were really heavily impacted and we got all of the regional governors from those sections of the country to come and meet with not only each other but also with the national government authorities. Next slide please. \r\n And here is just some depictions of what the hall looked like, some of the meetings going on. And it was really a well-rounded presentation in that we had, you know, exhibitors had booths where they could actually show product. We had social events. We had educational events. This photo is showing the briefing for U.S. exhibitors that Mitch Larsen at the Embassy put on. \r\n And I might add at this point too that the patron sponsor of that event was a company out of the United States called AECOM who had been very heavily involved in the rebuilding of New Orleans after Katrina. And they were supported by another company, (Jenner) and Dupont. But in addition there were 65 separate companies exhibiting at that show. Next slide please. \r\n Now back to the three regions and the presentations that were given during the first show. All three of the regional governors got up and spoke about their regions and about their plans and about what it is that they are anticipating needing as the reconstruction effort continues. And again, the three regions are six, seven and eight. Next slide please. \r\n And in particular those regions as you can see from these photos were very heavily damaged both in terms of housing, in terms of factories, hospitals, schools, utilities and roadways and they briefed us all at that point about, you know, how badly things were impacted. Next slide. Next slide please. Oh there we are. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Sorry. I'm having technical difficulties. \r\n Peter McKenna Okay. There you go. But what they also assured us that at that time already by June about three months after the actual earthquake and tsunami they have pretty much stabilized the situation to where they had provided temporary housing for the some 800,000 people who were without homes. \r\n They had provided temporary schools for the students to go back to. They had stabilized the medical emergencies so that everybody that needed healthcare was getting it. And really the clock that they were racing against was the onset of winter, which in the Southern hemisphere comes June, July and August. \r\n And they wanted to make sure everything was okay for people's basic needs during those months. And they are - they were even by June pretty stable in that regard. But not it's time to look at the long-term reconstruction needs. Next slide please. \r\n And that's where the leader of Region 8, which if you remember from my facts and figures there is by far the largest of the regions and is in terms of population and economic wherewithal the capital city of that region is Concepcion. And their intendente, a woman named Jacqueline van Rysselberghe spoke at our conference. \r\n But during that presentation, she said, \"You know, it's great that you're here in Santiago talking to the national government but we would also equally like you to come down to our region where the actual damage took place.\" And the fact of the matter is you don't see a lot of visible damage in Santiago. But when you get down to (Rencala) and (Poka) and Concepcion, you see a lot of damage. \r\n And she was saying, \"You know, come on down and actually see where we need your support and your products and your ideas.\" But for the first time too, she zeroed in on the idea that, you know, this tragedy has happened but don't feel bad about trying to make an opportunity out of it because she certainly is looking at that that way. And could I have the next slide please? \r\n This is an aerial shot of one of the coastal regions of her region prior to the earthquake and tsunami. Next shot please or next screen. And this is the same exact visual of that area. You can see the type of destruction and damage that was caused. \r\n And you can look at that as just saying, \"My God, what are we going to do about all of this. It's horrible.\" Or you can say, \"Well you know what, now that that exists as it is now, what can we do to make it better? What can we rebuild in that same space that is far better than what we lost? And could I have the next slide please? \r\n Here is an example. Again, a specific beachfront area where a lot of fishermen had their homes and their businesses prior to the 27th of February. And next slide please. \r\n This is an idea of what that area could look like given, you know, the right imagination and the right amount of commitment. And certainly the government is on this. They're saying we will support it financially. We'll support whatever laws need to be changed in order to make the zoning things happen. But we do need ideas. We need materials and we need, you know, basically expertise from outside of the region. Next slide please. \r\n And so hence the idea again was born right then and there of having the event but this time having a little bit longer lead time so that more of you could decide to actually be part of it. But also to hold it right where the need is greatest in Concepcion. Next slide. \r\n Here's showing a couple of the letters of support that we've received from the regional authorities in two. We actually have all three regions very much lining up behind this and promising that not only will they attend but they will invite national government figures to come down from Santiago. \r\n They will invite their local trade association representatives, local construction companies, investors, et cetera. And I actually have a slide coming showing the type of visitors that we are anticipating coming to the show in Concepcion. Next slide please. \r\n And by the way, all of this is available on our Web site. So I just wanted to assure you that if you don't have a chance to get it here, you'll see it there. The visitors that we're looking for will be regional construction industry people. And specifically we did include hospital administrators and educational institutions because that is a big part of the economy in Concepcion. \r\n They have a number of universities and also one of the largest hospitals in Latin America. So we - and the timing of this comes at a time when they're going to be making a lot of long term decisions about how they're going to rebuild both the medical facilities and the educational institutions. \r\n We'll be looking for all sorts of public sector leaders both from Chile and those from the - or from Santiago and from the region to come and specifically those in planning departments and different architectural and construction agencies like public works and housing. \r\n We're also though looking, and I know that Matthew mentioned the idea of entering into joint ventures with Chilean companies to win some of the bigger contracts with the Federal Government and we will be encouraging people that already have contracts for the reconstruction to come to the event so that they can then look for sub suppliers. \r\n We're also looking for international investors who may be interested in all sorts of opportunities that are available for things like building shopping malls or hotels or different tourist attractions, factories, et cetera. And again, from the government point of view they're offering a lot of incentives to companies to do that. \r\n In terms of exhibitors, basically it's all of those types of companies who offer either a product or a service that can be used for the long-term reconstruction of the country. And again echoing something that Matthew mentioned, a huge priority for Chile is anything to do with environmental sustainability and sort of overall green issues. \r\n And that comes both from an understanding that that is the wave of the future but also that Chile doesn't have a lot of oil and gas resources. It's strong in other minerals and agriculture. But to the extent that it doesn't have to import energy and can be using its wind power or solar power, et cetera, that's what they're aiming to do. Next slide please. \r\n Delia Valdivia: And Peter, we're going to need to wrap it up in the next slide. \r\n Peter McKenna Right. Okay. And we will. This is a floor plan showing that the Sur Activo Exhibition Center in Concepcion did not have any damage by the earthquake, ready to receive U.S. and exhibitors from throughout the world. Next slide. \r\n Basically the component elements are a trade show, a conference that will be taking place side by side with it. We'll be conducting VIP tours. We'll offer companies the opportunity to do presentations of their own. There'll be a load of media coverage, social events, site visits around the Concepcion region. \r\n And lastly, we produce a book called the Source Book which will list everybody in and it will have their contact details for people in Chile that want to buy from them. And I think this is the last slide coming now. \r\n Yeah. So thank you very much for your time and I'll remain on the line here to answer any questions. I would also like to just drop one other name here. My colleague (Krista March) is the one that's actually running the U.S. pavilion and sort of a day-to-day point of contact for that. And I'll have her contact the individual companies to introduce herself and answer any further question that they might have as well. \r\n Also in the room with me is our colleague from our office in Santiago, (Rodrigo Bastidas). And he too is happy to answer any questions anybody might have. Thank you. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Thank you Peter. Thank you. Thank you to all of our other speakers, Matthew, Marcello and (Carolina) for their presentations. And now that we've received all this information on the U.S. Commercial Service and how we can proceed in getting some bids, your next step would be to contact your local trade specialist. \r\n If you're not currently working with a commercial service, you can go on to our Web site at export.gov and click on the contact us link and you would enter your information and then they will tell you who you will need to contact. And give them a call and they're ready to help you. \r\n And with that, we're going to open it to questions and answers, the Q\u0026amp;A section of this Webinar. \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. At this time we will begin a question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star 1 on your touchtone phone. Please un-mute the line and record your first and last name when prompted. To withdraw the question, please press star 2. Once again, please press star 1 for any questions. One moment please. \r\n Once again, you may press star 1 for a question. One moment please. Questions are populating just now. One moment. \r\n Ms. Danielle Milam, your line is open from Franklin International. \r\n Danielle Milam: Thank you. I have two questions. Is it possible - we are not new to exports. However, we are new with this particular product line in Chile. Is it possible to go direct and talk with the U.S. Commercial Service in Santiago or do we have to work through a - through our local office here? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Thanks for the question. This is Matthew in Santiago. You can work - you can work directly with us. We always keep informed our local offices simply so that they can help and support when possible or when needed. But when it comes to specific information about Chile and its market, we are the experts. So come to us directly. \r\n Danielle Milam: Can I ask another question? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Sure. \r\n Danielle Milam: Is it possible because I travel to Chile regularly to meet if I schedule that with your or one of your colleagues in advance? \r\n Delia Valdivia: That's definitely possible. This is Delia. But the best thing to do would be to contact the local office just so you have no problem in case - if an email doesn't funnel through or something happens. It's best if you inform the local - your local office to make sure that you have a secure appointment with either Matthew or Marcello. \r\n Danielle Milam: Okay. And this is my final question. Is it possible to - we make construction adhesives or mastics for the building industry, sealants and things of that sort. Is it possible to either purchase or acquire through the Commercial Service in Chile market reports on the types of building constructions and materials because we know that concrete is used heavily in Chile. \r\n And I don't now if in the reconstruction they may be considering more U.S. style of how thing - you know, using what we would call the wood frame structure and plywood and OSB. And we're trying to get a handle on the materials and substrates and building styles being used to identify the most appropriate adhesives. Is that the type of information we could acquire? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Matthew again here. Certainly. We can - whatever we have to do - if it's not off the shelf and something that specific probably wouldn't be off the shelf, therefore we would conduct a research - we'd do our own research and create a report for you. And with that you could - you'd have the answers to your questions. \r\n Danielle Milam: Okay. \r\n Delia Valdivia: It would be a customized market research for you. \r\n Danielle Milam: Okay. \r\n Delia Valdivia: (Unintelligible) question. \r\n Danielle Milam: All right. Very good. Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: Mr. Chip Setzer, Tumac Lumber. Your line is open. \r\n Chip Setzer: Okay. I just have one question and it pertains to building materials. We're an export lumber company. We actually import lots of products from Chile here to the United States and other countries in the world. I'm intrigued to know as far as North American softwoods go and hardwood, is there truly an open opportunity because there's some significantly large companies in Chile and imagine are probably very interested in having that business all to themselves. \r\n And if so, is there any way to get like a list of companies that would be interested in North American species? \r\n Marcello Orellana: This is Marcello. Well, since you're aware of the country, you already know that LP's here and there's some also local lumber and veneer companies. And you're right. It's very hard to compete with (unintelligible) and the eucalyptus prices in general. \r\n And so - but unless there's a specific niche product, you know, where you can work with the, you know, the, you know, Ponderosa Pine or the Yellow Pine, you know, or any other American species, there may be a possibility. \r\n But you're right. I mean the - as an FYI, the number of houses that are being built nowadays and the proposals for the houses which are roughly 46 to 50 square meters are primarily based on OSB and other types of wood panel, veneer panels. \r\n And you may be aware of these things but they are, you know, essentially radiata and/or eucalyptus based panels. So again, unless there is an energy efficiency angle to using U.S. made, you know, wood products, it will be - it will be quite of a challenge to compete with these very cheap sources of wood and wood related products. \r\n Chip Setzer: That was sort of my impression of it to be honest. I just, you know, through my local U.S. export assistant program, you know, they thought it might be of interest. There might be a potential there. But I, you know, that was sort of my assumption. And, you know, there's nothing wrong with that. I understand that and I respect that, so. \r\n Marcello Orellana: Sure. \r\n Chip Setzer: It was worth exploring. \r\n Delia Valdivia: I have a question from one of the participants. The question is is the Chilean Government extending any relief of importation duties on building materials and productions to be used for reconstruction? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Sorry, you said are they reducing import duties. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Yeah. Are they - is there any import duty relief or reduction on building materials? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: You know, anything from U.S. is going to come in under the free trade agreement in which tariffs on this sort of thing are already at zero. So there's no reduction needed. Now other countries of course we're not concerned with Chile purchasing of things that are not U.S. but there they might run into a duty but not with U.S. made - not the things that qualify under the treaty as U.S. originated. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Okay. Thank you. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Yeah. \r\n Coordinator: I have four more questions on the audio portion so far. Tyrone Burks, Vision Worldwide Trading. Your line is open. \r\n Tyrone Burks: Yes. My question is - I'm Mr. Burks from Vision Worldwide Trading. And I would like - how can my company do business with you guys because I am what you call an exporter, a liaison person. And I put buyers together. So how would that work with me? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Well here - Matthew here again. We're happy to work with anybody - yes, this is Matthew here. We're happy to work with anybody who is supporting U.S. exports. And if your clients are exporters, we're happy to support you in supporting them... \r\n Tyrone Burks: Okay. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: ...in general terms. Yeah. \r\n Tyrone Burks: Okay. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Now... \r\n Tyrone Burks: All right. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: ...as long - you know, the trick is you or anyone in your business seems to understand your client very well. When we run into trouble it's with consultants or traders or others who really don't know the product that well. And then when we ask questions and try to get through the opportunities that might exist, if you don't know the answers, well then, you know, we're kind of - we don't know where to go from there. \r\n But assuming you represent them well and know their products and their businesses, then there's no reason why you can't talk directly to us and then support your clients that way. \r\n Coordinator: Would you like to take the next question? (Kermali Jaleah) of APS Group International. Your line is open. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Oh thank you. I have a question is we are in global company and we export a lot of material such as heavy equipment and metals for the commercial warehousing and commercial (molds) and stuff. \r\n How do I get information to that and we are, like I said, we do export cranes and heavy constructions equipment for the cement mixer machines and so forth. Have not done business with Chile but I have done business with other Latin American countries. So how do I get access to that and what are the procedures. \r\n Delia Valdivia: This is Delia. First what I would recommend is that you go on to our Web site, export.gov. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Okay. \r\n Delia Valdivia: And if you're not working currently with somebody in the Commercial Service, try to contact your local trade specialist. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Oh okay. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Then we'll connect you not only with Chile but with other markets and also keep you informed if there are any trade leads. Occasionally we'll get emails from our colleagues telling us this is needed in this market. And then we can funnel those through to our clients. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Okay. \r\n Delia Valdivia: So the best thing for me to advise to you would be to contact the local trade specialists in your area. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Fair enough. Thank you. And one more thing. Do - I could not hear the - half of this seminar. So how do I get a copy of it? How can I be able to listen to seminar from start one? \r\n Delia Valdivia: Just so you all know, we will be emailing you a link to the audio portion of the... \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Beautiful. \r\n Delia Valdivia: ...Webinar and it'll also have the slide that you can access. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Thanks. Okay. I really do appreciate it. \r\n Delia Valdivia: No problem. Thank you. \r\n (Kermali Jaleah): Bye bye ma'am. Bye. \r\n Coordinator: Mr. Guy Holman of Omega Masonry. Your line is open. \r\n Guy Holman: Yes. Hi. Guy Holman here. I had a question regarding existing zoning and building codes. Is there a way to access, you know, either electronically or in (unintelligible) format existing codes? \r\n Marcello Orellana: This is Marcello. Yes. There is a - there is a way of getting. I don't know about the electronic form. Or experience with zoning map is they are - when you get one zoning map for a specific area or town, it's a - basically it's a very dynamic - a very dynamic map of any given zone particularly after an earthquake of this magnitude. \r\n But there are - they're not easy to get. I've seen them. I know it's something it's possible to get them. And they're rather - they try to keep them on hard copies more than in electronic form. \r\n So if you would like to get a specific zoning for a specific zone in any particular city, you have to be very focused on which one are you interested and knowing that there is a, you know, these things, you know, normally take - requires a fee to be paid as a business facilitation services from our side and also to the Government entities that issue these documents. \r\n But it's possible to get them. But, you know, with this disclaimer that it's - they are very dynamic documents. \r\n Guy Holman: Okay. \r\n Marcello Orellana: And I would suspect that they would be even more so given the changes that Matthew indicated earlier in the presentation. You know, the expo revealed once to, you know, most of the authorities want to go back to a - they don't want to go back. They want to move forward and have new zoning for new areas. So I'm pretty sure that all of the zoning maps and zoning criteria are being revised as we speak. \r\n Guy Holman: Okay. So with the whole rebuilding process and with the revamping of coal just sort of like a work in progress, so they're really looking at, you know, from the design build category. I would say there would be a tremendous opportunity there. \r\n Marcello Orellana: Yes. Yes. There would be a tremendous - but keep in mind that as Matthew also indicated that this is a highly competitive country. It's a completely open economy. And so it is engineering firms or zoning expertise from Latin Americans though European countries or even Asian countries, they will also be looking at it and because of the competitiveness scenario in the country. \r\n Guy Holman: Okay. And just lastly, can you talk just about the realities of trying stage a project in the current conditions in Chile in terms of just the logistics of getting things around roads and, you know, getting product to the site, those type of conditions that are on the ground? \r\n Marcello Orellana: Well, as was described earlier in the presentation, Chile came out of the what we could term the emergency status. And the roads are there. They need to be - the - most of the bridges are back to - you know, they can be used although they are temporary bridges. Most of them - most of the roads are being, you know, used, you know, lateral roads or alternative routes if it's not possible to use the highways. \r\n But in general the country is working under fairly normal conditions. You know, the telecommunications, the, you know, the road infrastructure it's rendering the service it's supposed to except that there's many detours. Sometimes in terms of using, you know, double lane roads, then you have to use one lane or use an alternative route. \r\n But the country is connected in all ways not only as far as roads are concerned but, you know, telecommunications. So in order to get a project done basically I would say that, and it was mentioned by Matthew as well, we would say that the key element is to get a local partner that will help you understand the details on how to go about getting into a project and understanding. \r\n For example, you know, what is a concession, how to work with concessionaires, how to work with the Chilean Government, et cetera, et cetera. And that's where we come in. You know, that's how we can help you. You can tell us, you know, I would like to partner up with a company that has such expertise in this particular field and we can move from there and start from there finding an appropriate contact or partner for you. \r\n Delia Valdivia: I have a quick question from one - another participant. Is there - is the Chilean Government have - do they have any regulations as far as rebuilding what green products or green technology? Can you guys answer that? \r\n Marcello Orellana: This is Marcello again. There is a big push and it's coming on very strong and you may be familiar with the lead certification of construction infrastructure. It makes an important difference. Some new projects that are green projects will have a better chance of getting more attention in the international community, you know, keeping in mind that this is an - again, I cannot over stress the fact that this is an open economy. \r\n You will find everybody here; the Germans, the Italians, the French, you know, the Australians, the New Zealanders and they are all looking for opportunities in these areas. \r\n And certainly the - this type of certification, this green type of certifications are as you know in international markets are very well regarded. And the local developers know that. So they are setting up and putting up buildings with this type of certification. So the answer is yes, it's something that it's coming on very strong and as you know, it's, you know, and they're coming to stay. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: I do have four more questions on the phone. Tyrone Burks, Vision Worldwide. Your line is open. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Can I just say one thing before you ask your question? We're now entering into - we've been on for one hour. And that's the time we said for the duration of the Webinar. If there's more questions, please feel free to ask them. But for other individuals if you have to get off the phone, we want to respect your time. \r\n This is being recorded. So if you need to leave, you'll be able to access this at a later time. Okay. Thank you. Go ahead. \r\n Tyrone Burks: Okay. I was interrupted and I didn't get to hear - finish hearing what he was saying about my company about me being a liaison person. And how can I - how can you guys work with me in partnering up with someone? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Well, it's Matthew again. If you didn't hear my answer, it was we can work together. I'd like to discuss the details, you know, offline. \r\n Tyrone Burks: Okay. \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: We support anybody who is working with the U.S. - with a U.S. exporter. I mean if we don't, you know, you can't just be moving product from China through the U.S. Then you don't qualify. But if you work with a legitimate U.S. exporter, we'd love to work with you. \r\n Tyrone Burks: Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. That sounds great. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Dario Rivera) of (Solv Solutions). Your line is open. \r\n (Dario Rivera): Hi. Thank you. I work with a company that supplies simulators for training operators in different industries including but not limited to construction port, transportation, trains, bosses, I mean you name it. They have different kinds of simulators. \r\n I would like to ask you about your perspectives on this, how you see the current opportunities in Chile for this kind of product. \r\n Marcello Orellana: We have two people that can answer this question so - certainly, now when you talk about simulators, are these very sort of the type of, you know, F16 flight simulators, you know, for (unintelligible) simulators but for other applications (unintelligible). \r\n (Dario Rivera): These are simulators for a specific application like dozer simulation, backhoe simulators. \r\n Marcello Orellana: Okay. \r\n (Dario Rivera): Train - being about to operate a train simulator. Very (unintelligible). \r\n Marcello Orellana: Well, there is a - there is a huge demand for that in this country. Okay. The trick is that the amount of capital investment required to bring some of these machine is basically prohibitive for many of the companies that would like to use this type of technology. \r\n But the demand is certainly here. Keeping in mind that this is a - not only a mining country but a country that runs public transportation but lets public transportation to be taken care of by private companies. And so there's a lot of demand for teaching new drivers how to drive large buses and, you know, huge and heavy trucks used in the mining sector as well as a construction sector. \r\n So there are opportunities there. The only challenge as indicated is, you know, the capital outlay for, you know, for these type of machineries. Something that I would say that that's where the challenge resides. You know, how to get a - you know, hundreds of, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars equipment down here and get the return on the investment there quickly enough to, you know, make sense. \r\n But the need is there. In fact some of the current bus operators are inclined to do something to get that type of technology into the country but something that we can certainly help you with and getting you the - not only the right information but the right companies to work with. \r\n (Dario Rivera): Are we speaking of a specific - are you talking about specific model, brand model or just conceptually speaking of the technology? \r\n Marcello Orellana: Depending on the industry, can be a specific module. For example in train can be a specific machine. Other ones are generic. But it depends on the industry. \r\n (Dario Rivera): Who do I talk to on this regard? \r\n (Claudia) Melkonian: Hi. This is (Claudia) Melkonian here in Santiago. Please contact me and I can do a little research for your product. And because now like this minute, I would not have ready information for you, so please contact me here at the office, (Claudia).Melkonian at trade.gov and we can talk about this. \r\n (Dario Rivera): (Claudio.) what? \r\n (Claudia) Melkonian: (Claudia).Melkonian, M-E-L-K-O-N-I-A-N at trade.gov. \r\n (Dario Rivera): Trade.gov. Oh I got part of that. \r\n (Claudia) Melkonian: Sorry. \r\n (Dario Rivera): I got part of the information. \r\n Delia Valdivia: We can follow up with you afterwards with the contact information. \r\n (Claudia) Melkonian: Yes. \r\n (Dario Rivera): Please. Thank you. Thank you very much. \r\n (Claudia) Melkonian: You're welcome. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from Mr. (Steven Peters) of (Finnell and Peters) International. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question Mr. (Peters). Please check your mute switch. Mr. (Peters) your line is open. Go ahead Mr. (Peters) with you question. \r\n Delia Valdivia: And we can move on to the next. \r\n Coordinator: Okay. Mr. Robert Allen, you line is open. \r\n Robert Allen: Hello. \r\n Coordinator: Your line is open from STOIC International. \r\n Robert Allen: Can you hear me? \r\n Coordinator: Yes we can. \r\n Robert Allen: Hi. This is Robert Allen, STOIC International. I have a couple of different questions, market sectors I want to get some information on. Namely in the beginning what is the status of the water resources in Chile? Is there a shortage of water? Is there water but it's contaminated or is everything - do they have a sufficient water need? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: This is Matthew. We're divided up into sectors here. Our water expert isn't in the room currently. You know, overall Chile is - has a lot of fresh water, more than most countries do per square mile given their - you know, the mountains and the snow and the rivers. \r\n And in fact you can drink the water here if that's at all relevant to the discussion. It's - the water supply is good overall. But for your question, we would love to get to you later and answer specifically and find out how we can help and where there's an opportunity. But I just don't have a way to answer it all right now. But what is the specific question if I may - we may ask you? \r\n Robert Allen: Just as far as the water availability and the resources of water. I know from Mexico has a very big shortage of water. And... \r\n Marcello Orellana: Are you talking about drinking water or industrial water? \r\n Robert Allen: Drinking. Consumable. \r\n Marcello Orellana: Okay. As Matthew indicated, the person in charge of that but what I, you know, what we can try I mean at this time is that one of - the water supply was one of the I would say the first - one of the first elements that was addressed right after the new administration came into power which was March 12. \r\n And it was given, you know, the highest priority to have the water network back into operation as much as possible. But there were some obviously as, you know, as you can imagine, you know, with an 8.8 earthquake, there was a lot of - a lot of damage in the water distribution network. \r\n And the - but the current status is something that one of our colleagues would be able to give you a better indication. \r\n Robert Allen: Okay. Another brief question here. You all had mentioned the possibility of - the door was open for joint ventures with foreign and Chilean companies to land bigger projects, construction bids and all. Is that pretty much the only way a foreign company would land the large projects? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Is that the only way a big company would land one of those contracts? \r\n Robert Allen: Right. I know a lot of times foreign countries they try to make it so it's difficult for a foreign country to win the big bucks. Is there such an obstacle in Chile? \r\n Matthew Hilgendorf: Right. I understand the - I understand the phenomenon. It's - I don't - there's nothing here that says that a foreign company cannot win a concession or a contract. However, it just turns out that the ones that associate and create an alliance and bring the best product offering are the ones that win. And it typically is somebody who's, you know, partners. \r\n Robert Allen: Right. \r\n Marcello Orellana: And in addition to that, to answer your question, it's yes. Foreign countries can get into the big bucks projects. And I'll give you a couple of examples. One is the Santiago metropolitan area public transportation system is in private foreign hands as we speak. \r\n The - most of the electricity generated in the country is in private foreign hands. Some of the tenders for telecommunications for example are also in private foreign hands. The only caveat to the comment is that these foreign companies have been here in the country so they understand the culture and the procedures. \r\n They're not - I mean they're not - they don't make them difficult so that private foreign companies cannot come in. It's just that it's need to understand, you know, how to operate with their regulations. Okay. But the market is open and in fact you were concerned about - one of your question was the water supply. \r\n Well the Canadians own a big chunk of the water supply in this country through a pension fund. \r\n Robert Allen: Interesting. \r\n Marcello Orellana: And so the, you know, the Italians are and the Spaniards, the French, the Germans, they're in many different areas and that's why it's so relevant and that was the relevancy of the - of telling you there is something that's called the concession program which most of the big project, large projects are developed. \r\n You know, meaning, you know, they could go from highways to hospitals to schools, to prisons and you name it, all the big bucks projects as you indicated. \r\n Robert Allen: One last part of the question here regarding these tenders and the trade lead. And it's a double fold question. Number 1, is - how much of the leads that are open down there will appear on the USCS Web site trade leads and is there a formal site in Chile that one can go to to review the different tenders? \r\n Marcello Orellana: Well for the large - some of the large projects, there is a Web site that - you know, there is a company, you know, for fee company, private company that lists all the big - some of the big infrastructure projects named mostly mining projects. \r\n The name escapes me right now but there is one. And you can certainly send me an email --this is Marcello -- to ask me what's the name of that Web site. I just don't remember exactly right now. But it lists, you know, the type of projects, you know, where are they going to come into and what stage are they in and when they're coming into the, you know, different development stage. \r\n And also, you know, one of my colleagues (unintelligible) is just jotting down here some of the other Web sites having to do with infrastructure. One of them is mop and mop.cl under projects 2010, 2014. And then there's another Web site by the name of concession.cl. You'll see some of the, you know, the large infrastructure projects there. You know, it's public works mostly. \r\n Robert Allen: Okay. Thank you. \r\n Marcello Orellana: You're welcome. \r\n Coordinator: Another question has populated. Ree Russell of U.S. Commercial Service, Charlotte. Your line is open. \r\n Ree Russell: Thank you. I'm calling to ask if the demolition work has been done. Has the demolition company been selected or are there certain demolition projects that are still available to U.S. companies to bid on? \r\n Marcello Orellana: This is Marcello again. There is plenty of demolition available here. Now to whether they are open to U.S. companies, the same strategy holds as indicated earlier. The idea is to get in touch with us so that we can find out who locally is handling these demolition projects. \r\n But keep in mind that we're looking at almost 1/5 of the country that was hit pretty badly. So there's a lot of rubble still, you know, even in Santiago, okay. That's - but again, as Matthew mentioned, the best and most practical way would be to first talk to us so that we can help you find an appropriate partner and that can tell you, you know, what's the very latest status on the demolition opportunities. \r\n But there's a lot to be - there's a lot of buildings that need to be demolished. They're deciding as we speak on which ones and how to - where are they going to start? Are they going to start in Santiago or are they going to start in (Van Carwa), Concepcion. It's not only building but also bridges need to be rebuilt. \r\n Ree Russell: Is there a central ministry that's managing that? \r\n Marcello Orellana: The Ministry of Public Works. \r\n Ree Russell: Okay. \r\n Marcello Orellana: And that was one of the Web sites we indicated to the - in the earlier portion. That's mop.cl. \r\n Ree Russell: Thanks. \r\n Marcello Orellana: You're welcome. \r\n Coordinator: Currently no questions have populated. Would you like me to give the scripting again on how to ask a question? \r\n Delia Valdivia: I think we're - we've gone 20, almost 20 minutes over the hour. So I think we probably want to wrap it up now. \r\n Coordinator: Okay. Thank you. \r\n Delia Valdivia: So thank you all for joining us and like me mentioned, this call, the Webinar portion will be sent out. A link for the Webinar portion will be sent out to all the participants. So you can access it at any time after the call. \r\n Coordinator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you. \r\n Delia Valdivia: Operator, can you have the speakers in one please? \r\n Coordinator: Yes ma'am. One moment. \r\n Man: Hello. \r\n Woman: Yes. \r\n Coordinator: One moment please. One moment please. \r\n Woman: Okay. \r\n END \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-14","title":"NMEI: Rebuild Efforts in Chile","update_date":"2013-05-14","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Construction Building \u0026 Heavy Equipment"],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Chile"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"497","content":" October 8, 2009 \r\n This webinar will familiarize you with the Indian market.

Thank you, Margaret, for your help in coordinating this webinar. \r\n Good afternoon, everyone. And it’s great to be here back in St. Louis and Missouri. And I look forward to working with you to help you succeed in India. \r\n The U.S.-India relationship is really at its high point right now. And you probably know that President Obama has invited the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to be the first state guests here in the United States in November, and that really testifies to the – to the strength of our relationship. It’s a very exciting time to be doing business in India, with lots of opportunities. But there are a number of pitfalls, which I’ll talk about later in the – in the presentation. \r\n India, since it liberalized its economy in 1991, has really become an economic powerhouse in the global economy. And this is – this has been a trend that is shifting, and we don’t expect it to go back to the old days. They slowly reduced their barrier – their tariffs and other barriers, so U.S. companies are finding it easier to do – to do business now. But with all the opportunities that India has, there are – there are a number of challenges, and so we advise companies to proceed slowly and know the people they’re doing business with. \r\n What’s particularly exciting about India – and this has been a new development in the past 10 years – is that the private sector is really taking charge. You know, there are lucrative government contracts, but they pale in comparison to the opportunities in the private sector. \r\n India, of course, is a huge country with over a billion people, but what’s exciting and important to note is that it’s a very young country, which will really be a factor for doing business in the next 15 years. And in contrast to China, which – U.S. companies really compare India to China – China, having the one-child-per-family policy, will look very, very different in another 10 or 15 years. So India, with its young population, will have even more opportunities for U.S. firms. \r\n Of course, the middle class is growing and developing. The size of the middle class depends on who you talk to and what statistics they use. But again, that talks – testifies to the opportunities for U.S. companies. One thing I’d like to point out, however, is that middle class in India is significantly different from our standard middle class, you know, where you talk about, you know, a house and two cars. India, the middle class might be a family of four riding on a motorcycle. So it’s, you know, very, very, very different. \r\n Also, you know, Indians are big spenders, so the private consumption indicated on the slide is 62 percent of GDP, so lots of opportunity. The momentum, as I said, is very strong, we expect it to continue in the – in the – in the future. \r\n And what’s really exciting about India is that the economy is still growing in an area where most of our world economies are shrinking or having very, very anemic growth. The next slide shows that we’re looking at 5 to 6 percent growth this year. It’s down a little bit from the 8 to 9 percent growth that we’ve had in the past couple years. But again, this is one of the few economies that still has great, great opportunities. \r\n India is really weathering the financial crisis quite nicely. Part of this is due to the fact that they have – their export-oriented sector is not as big as other countries’. Those export-oriented industries, such as textiles, jewelry, automotive components and many others, they are hurting. But India’s also a cash-based economy. A lot of business is done – well, most business is done on a cash basis. So they have that buffer to help them. \r\n A lot of foreign investors are still coming into India. The United States is the number-one foreign investor. And a significant shift is that opportunities are moving from the main areas, you know, such as Delhi, Mumbai and the other major cities, to the second-tier cities and the rural areas. India’s still very much a village-dominated country, so a lot of the most savvy companies are really targeting their marketing campaigns towards the rural customer, most of which, you know, have cell phones and have access to Internet on, you know, their village Internet cafes. \r\n So, you know, India is suffering. I don’t want to make light of the fact that it’s suffering, as the rest of the world is, with the economic downturn. But we really expect India to emerge brighter and stronger as a result. \r\n This graph just shows the trade that skyrocketed since the year 2000. You know, you can see that – a significant jump in the year 2007, where we made significant inroads. And in that case, we sold a bunch of Boeing planes to India. But what’s exciting is that the growth continues in 2008. \r\n In the first six months of this year, however, we saw a 7.9-percent decrease. And that might sound alarming – and perhaps it is – but even at a 7.9-percent decrease, we’re still higher than where we were in 2007. We’ve really seen things turn around in the past couple months, so I’m hoping as we come to a close of the calendar year 2009, that we’ll be able to make inroads into that. \r\n A couple years ago when President Bush got together with Manmohan Singh, they made a pledge to double our bilateral trade. And as you see – within five years. And as you see, we’ve been able to do that. And when President Obama and Manmohan Singh get together, we’ll see if they make a similar pledge to keep us all very busy. \r\n India – with it – with its skyrocketing trade, India has leapfrogged its position in terms of importance to U.S. companies. In 2003, it was the number-25 export market. Now it’s number 14. And I would just stress that in the – in the next 10 years, it would probably – in the next couple years, it would probably be in the top 10 percent – top-10 list. So for those of you doing business in other markets, the graph on the right kind of shows the indicators of the – our top export markets and their growth rate. \r\n India is becoming a more and more confident country for many, many reasons, but their largest companies are looking to invest in the United States now. So you see this slide, it shows our investment in India, which is impressive. But you see the increase in Indian investment in the United States. And we think this will increase even more dramatically, which is good news for us. It creates jobs and helps sustain our industries. \r\n The U.S. Commercial Service has offices in seven cities in India. I cover south India, so Hyderabad, state of Andhra Pradesh and the southern states. What’s interesting to note in doing business in India is that it’s such a vast and diverse country. So doing business in Delhi and Calcutta, where I was before, is very, very different from doing business in the south. \r\n In Calcutta, where I was, for example, it’s a very social place. So before inking deals, people will want to have dinner with potential business partners; they – you know, to get – to get to know them. In the south, that doesn’t matter as much. They’re more, I guess, focused, and they’ll do a deal and not necessarily care as much who’s on the other side. But these things are all very important factors to consider. And given our extensive inroads in India, we can hopefully navigate those things. \r\n What we want to do is help you succeed in the Indian market, so we do what it takes to help you make a deal, to help you get your goods out of customs, to help you get paid by your partner who’s avoiding your phone calls. You let us know what your problem is, and we will work with you to craft a strategy to get the – get the job done and get the problem fixed. We have a number of different agencies in India. We work closely together. And we have the U.S. government clout to help step in when things are sometimes at a – at an impasse. \r\n It’s really hard to talk about the top sectors in India, because there are so many. Aviation and aircraft parts is the number-one sector in terms of dollar value. But there’s very few sectors that don’t have potential in India. And I’ll talk about it a bit later, but the main barrier for U.S. companies to do business in India is the price factor. But the – commercial nuclear power is one area that has just bloomed, in large part due to the – due to the civil nuclear agreement that we signed – ratified last year. \r\n Aerospace and defense, of course, is a – is a huge sector. In November, we are – we will be bringing a trade mission of 10 companies to New Delhi, Bangalore and Hyderabad to meet with the Indian civil entities to hopefully make sales. \r\n Energy efficiency and solar power, clean energy, is another huge area that we’re focusing on right now. We have a couple of trade missions coming up, one energy efficiency in November, and then a solar trade mission in – next February. \r\n And India, we see India kind of leapfrogging other countries, just the way that they have in the telecom sector. Many years – you know, years ago it was very difficult for an Indian company to – an Indian person to get a landline connection in their house. So as soon as cell phones came out, everybody rushed to get a cell phone, and they have a very impressive cell phone penetration rate. And we see that with energy, because energy – the energy demand far exceeds the supply. So they’re looking for nonconventional energy usage. And we see this as a very hot sector, and it could possibly surpass other countries in their usage of renewable energy. \r\n So some of the best bets in 2009, they’re listed here. Consumer goods, of course, with the rising middle class, is a – is a – is a key – a key sector. And again, this is where going to the second-tier cities is very important to do, because they’re not saturated with consumer goods, as other major cities are. The – the Mumbai attacks last November has really taken up the expensive security in the country. So safety and security equipment and services are in tremendous demand right now. \r\n Health care is another booming area. We will be leading a health care trade mission to India next March. And India really is trying to position itself as a medical tourism hub for U.S. and European patients who – they might not have the funds to get these expensive procedures done in the United States. You can have them done at a fraction of the cost in India. So they really need top-notch medical equipment to be able to attract that. And, of course, manufacturing and telecom. \r\n One thing I’d like to point out is that India is very interested in getting U.S. companies to set up their manufacturing base in India, which can oftentimes make business sense. That’s not what we do in the U.S. Department of Commerce, but – and as you go to India and we start looking for partners and things like that, that will come up in conversation from the – from the time you step off the plane. \r\n So in terms – I presented a very rosy view of doing business in India. And there are enormous opportunities, but there are a number of challenges to consider. One is, it takes a long time to do business. So I have at the top of the slide the three P’s. You need patience. It just – with the amazing diversity that they have, over 23 official language – you know, major regional languages, so many religions, so many different ethnic groups, it can be – it’s – there’s so much going on that it can be hard to get things done. So it does take longer to close a deal there. \r\n And you do need to be there. The presence is very important. You need to go there and meet face to face with your partners, develop a relationship with them. If you can’t be there full time, you need to have a local partner. It could be an agent, local office, distributor, representative. We can work with you to craft the strategy that makes most sense. It – depending on your sector, it could be that one office or one agent could service the whole country, or it might make sense to have a regional representation. Again, we will work with you to make sense. \r\n But the biggest factor, as I mentioned before, is price. India is a very price-sensitive country and market. So when we work with U.S. companies to determine whether there’s a market for their good or service, price is almost always the number-one hindering factor. \r\n In the case of automotive – the automotive sector, which is big in the south, where I am, for example, the after-market component and accessories, U.S. companies can’t compete on the basis of price, because India is flooded with, you know, Chinese goods, their own domestically produced goods. So the – it’s really – in that sector, U.S. companies that design high-end precision tools, the instrumentation, those are the things that could be competitive. \r\n Likewise, Starbucks has not been able to make inroads into India for a number of reasons, one of which is that they keep their prices the same around the world, unlike McDonald’s, which has different prices in different countries. You know, you pay $4 for a Starbucks coffee anywhere in the world, so they have not been able to make significant inroads. \r\n If you’re interested – if you’re interested in doing business in India, we do provide an analysis free of cost to you to determine whether your company has strong prospects in India right now. So my – I’ll give – leave my contact information at the end of the slide, and just contact me any time, or my colleagues in St. Louis, and we will work with you on that. \r\n Penetrate the regional market(s). And again, I talked about the second-tier cities. It’s important to get out beyond the main – the main areas. But also, India, because it’s so diverse – and, you know, it’s really a different country in the south than it is from the north – different languages, different customs, different – just everything is different. So it might make sense, as I mentioned before, to have a regional strategy in terms of doing business in India. \r\n You really need to know who you’re doing business with and do due diligence. And again, we can do background checks on companies that you might be appointing to representing you or if you’re signing a big deal. This is important, because what you see is not necessarily what you get in India. You can have major business leaders who have shady business arrangements, and it’s very important to know that beforehand, because the person might look very respectable, but is not – may not be the type of person – or they might have business practices that you’re not comfortable with. \r\n Intellectual property rights is, again, a big issue. They’re not enforced uniformly or at all sometimes in India. If you have a sensitive technology, you must get a – you must get a patent in India, because if you don’t – if you don’t and somebody copies it or takes it, they throw up their hands and say, well, you weren’t registered with us, even if you’re registered in every country around the world. \r\n So I have here “sharpen your pencil.” And again, that just goes hand in hand with what I’ve been saying. Really know who your partner is and what you – what you – who you’re working with. And I mentioned before, you need a local partner, some kind of local presence. India is still a traditional country in many, many ways, and personal contact, personal interactions, is very, very important. \r\n Make sure you get paid. Of course, that’s what it’s about at the end of the day. And with the economic downturn, I am seeing more complaints from U.S. companies needing our assistance to follow up with their partners who aren’t answering the phones. And, you know, make sure you structure your contracts or your payment policies accordingly. We usually recommend, you know, normal business caution when working with a new partner. And maybe, you know, try to get the payment up front first or, you know, proceed with caution in the beginning, and then as time goes on, you can perhaps provide more flexible payment options. \r\n So these are just some basic – a basic overview. For those of you who might be interested in government contracts, they can be lucrative. But the terms and conditions can be onerous, and sometimes so onerous that U.S. companies tell us they’re not interested in bidding on the – on the government contract. \r\n So I mentioned in the beginning that the growth in India is really driven by the private sector, and so most U.S. companies who are talking to us, you know, prefer the opportunities in the – in the private sector and see where that’s the major growth area. But in areas like mining, defense, aviation, you know, government contracts, of course, have – play a big, big role. \r\n Corruption is kind of like the big elephant in the room when doing business in India. And, you know, every year they have these different surveys in terms of the corruption indices, you know, done by the World Bank and other entities. And, you know, India kind of goes up and down on that list. But that’s still – it’s always an issue in terms of doing business there. And again, this is why you have to sharpen your pencil and have your eyes wide open, know who you’re doing business with to make sure that they have the same business practices that you’re comfortable with. \r\n So some U.S. companies have a preference of like “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy where, you know, their local person can do what it takes to get done as long as they don’t know about it. But again, we have very stringent, you know, policies with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that can sometimes put a U.S. company at jeopardy with what is, you know, against the law in our country. \r\n But even though it talks about the challenges, I just wanted to provide a very realistic overview of doing business in India. I think in most cases the opportunities far outweigh the problems. And again, this is – this is our goal, is to help you navigate the market, figure out the opportunities, meet the partners that you need to meet, but then also provide you information on the challenges so you can make your best decision in terms of deciding how to proceed in the market. \r\n So this is my contact information and also our website, which has some very comprehensive information. I didn’t want to talk too long, because I want to leave the bulk of the time for the question-and-answer session. But I look forward to working with you to help you succeed in India and look forward to the question-and-answer session. Thank you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you, Aileen. \r\n I’ve just put up Abdul’s presentation. Abdul, when you’re ready, you can begin. \r\n ABDUL SHAIKH: Okay. Thank you, Margaret. And thank you, Aileen, for an excellent presentation. And I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for joining us for this important webinar. \r\n I am at the Trade Information Center, and I call it the resource center. And we recently established India Business Center. And I’m going to talk about that, what it does, how it can help you. And Aileen has given you a very good overview of what are the potential markets in India and why we should focus on, but I think getting into what you need to know and how you get there and what kind of information that you can have, so India Business Center can provide that. \r\n India Business Center is a part of the larger Trade Information Center. So wherever you want to do trade, in any part of the world, you call us here. And we have established an 800 number. So if you don’t remember whatever I say, at least you should remember 1-800-USA-TRADE. That is the place where you can begin finding out the information about doing business overseas. \r\n Now, India Business Center is primarily focusing on India, because we find there is an increasing number of American companies are interested in doing business. You know, these are the two major mega markets, the China and India. In fact, recently we have started what we call a “Dueling Tigers” series of trade promotion, and I’ve been a part of that, trying to provide information and educate American companies that – why they should not miss the opportunity of taking advantage of the potential that exists in India. \r\n I think Aileen mentioned there is a growing middle class and their income is rising. Unlike here, their wages are rising too, because a majority of those are Internet-savvy. They are looking for, now, quality products, not just Chinese products. So this is a great opportunity for American companies with quality products to sell in India. So I would also give you various products and services, and then briefly talk about the challenges, I think some of which Aileen has already alluded. \r\n This is – I don’t know if anybody can see that – there is a map of India. And India is a very big country, but it is almost only one-third of the size of the United States, but it has four times the population. So you can see that how crowded it is. Any of you who have traveled to India, and the first thing you see is the people, first, you land in any of the airports, whether it is Mumbai or Chennai or New Delhi, so you’ll always find. \r\n And the southern part of India is much more advanced economically. In fact, six of the states provide about 65 percent of the gross domestic product. And then the western part of Haryana and Punjab, they are much more advanced, and then the middle part is the less developed. \r\n And some of the states like West Bengal, where Calcutta is, and Kerala, they are much more socialistic. And in fact, recently Tata wanted to establish their Nano car in Calcutta. They had to withdraw because the state was not able to provide, and there was a lot of hesitation and conflict between the farmers and the state. \r\n So India is a diverse country. As Aileen has indicated, it has a different culture, different classes. The food – the – from the south is different than from the north or the west or the east. They speak different languages. Although one advantage – I think one of the important legacies that the British left in India is the language, the English language. So unlike in China, you don’t need a translator here, because most of the people you are doing business with and correspond with, know English very well. So that is – that makes your life a lot easier to deal with the business. \r\n Now, what is the India Business Center? Now, this is – what we have is a part of the Trade Information Center. In fact, we have three business centers. One is India Business Center, another China Business Center, and the Middle East, because these are the three major markets we are exploring here. \r\n So you have information. If you go to a – the – our website, which is export.gov/india, so, the first thing you want to know, you know, there is a number of you who have signed up here, maybe first time looking at India. So if you want to do that, the first thing we have is how to start trading with India. What do you need to know? What are the prospects there? What kind of products they are looking? What are the requirements in terms of the documentation if you want to see it? What are the customs, duties? \r\n So this website provides a country commercial guide. So we have all 200 pages of the country commercial guide. We’ve talked about the Indian market, India as a whole, what are the policies and the problems that you encounter, how to open an office if you want to do that. So it is a very good information, and importantly, it is free. So if you go to export.gov and click on Market Research, it opens up a library, then you can do research on it. You can do research by the industry. So if you are in aerospace, consumer goods, telecommunication, and then you will find vast amount of market research reports that our Commercial Service is – in India is producing. And these are posted on this website, and this is a great resources. Because if you hire a researcher or a consultant, you have to pay quite a bit of money. \r\n And in order to export your product, one thing you need to know is what is the duties when it lands. And we can provide that. We have a website on it on our India Business Center. So you can look at that: what is the tariff, because India has several different tariff – (inaudible). There is a basic duty, there is a countervailing duty, there is education set. So it is a very complex phenomenon as far as the duties is concerned. \r\n They have been continuously reducing the tariff duty. Nonetheless, the duty is still high compared to other countries. So the duties then becomes a part of determination of competitiveness of your product. Because if the product costs here are hundred dollars and if you have to pay a 20-percent duty, so that would be $120. But if they can find a product for 110 (dollars), then the American product may not be purchased. So we can help you in that. And if you have questions on it, you just call 1-800-USA-TRADE. \r\n We also post on this website a number of trade events. In fact, you know, we are conducting these educational seminars throughout the country about India. We also post the webinars. I think, you know, last month we had one on India customs. We had about 120 people signed up. We talked about the procedures and the complexity of getting your product into India. So we are trying to identify the problems and issues and concerns of American companies to be successful trading in India, and then those kind of information is selected and disseminated and transmitted, and then – through these kind of seminars and events. \r\n Now, we also have trade leads. You know, this is a great thing, that if you are looking for what to sell, and these trade leads are perfect. They are generally screened, and therefore they are not scams, because, you know, you will find those scams quite a bit. \r\n So the market research, I was looking at how many reports we have on this website, India Business Center. You can see that we have 1,580 reports. And yet the information and communication markets, we are 234; health technologies 80; environmental, security and safety services. So you can see that depending upon what product or what category of industries that you are in and you want to know more about it, and that information. \r\n Now, each of these industry, you will find information as to the market, the competitors, what is the expected share of the U.S. market. So that gives you a good indication of what you can sell better in India. So this is important information if you are really interested to look at the market in India. \r\n I think Aileen talked about the current major prospect for American companies. Here is a whole list of things. You can sell, you know, anything and everything, but these are the best prospects that you have. You know, India is booming in construction. They are building new airports. They are building bridges. They are building roads and railways, housing. So it is a booming construction. So they are looking for all kinds of, you know, design and equipment. Because I had Larsen \u0026amp; Toubro here, which is a major construction firm. You know, they are not looking at the – how the pavement is done, but the designing of the roads. So they are really looking for American technical know-how and quality products they can use. \r\n I think Aileen mentioned about the medical equipment. The medical tourism is one of the big things. Some of the hospitals like in Chennai, Apollo in New Delhi, they are run by American-trained doctors. So they want to use most modern equipment. \r\n Education is another thing. India today has liberalized quite a bit, and there are more and more American universities wanting to participate. \r\n The food processing: You know, 60 percent of the food produced in India is wasted because of poor transportation, infrastructure, lack of storage facilities. So, you can see that India is looking. In fact, the food-processing minister I met in L.A. a few months ago, and he was telling us that, you know, he is really looking for American technology and American way of improving the storage and marketing of their products. \r\n So pollution controls and water treatment. \r\n And I think Aileen already mentioned that series of trade missions we are planning. And so – and all that information is posted on India Business Center, what trade mission is planned, where we are going, what is the focus of it, and, if you are – want to get in, how to apply for it and who is a coordinator for that. All that information is on India Business Center. \r\n So I think one of the things that you may want to do there to find out more information about India and doing business in India, you know, please go to India Business Center. And the Trade Information Center also works with the 19 other federal agencies. We work with SBA. We work with Export-Import Bank. We work with the TDA and – (word inaudible) – and many other agencies. So if you are exporting a product and you run into a financial issue, we will put you in touch with the Export-Import Bank person that – who would provide you assistance in coping with the financial side of it. \r\n So these are some of the challenges, I think. I don’t want to spend too much time. I think Aileen has already did that. \r\n So you have to be very careful. You know, there is corruption. But – there is intellectual property rights. But I think India is making progress, because I think they realize that software has to be protected too, because they are selling lot of those overseas. You know, in Cincinnati the Tata consultancy has opened up their office, and they are employing about 50 people from Ohio. So that is a good thing. And they also want to protect their intellectual property rights. So India is realizing that. \r\n And we have very good bilateral trade relationships. We constantly meet with – you know, there is the private sector group of executives from United States and counterpart in India. And these people meet every other month to hash out any problems that the American businesses face in doing business and the Indian business face. So we will take up those matters with their respective governments to resolve that. \r\n So there is a lot of progress. In fact, the bilateral relations between India is not only on trade, on commercial dialogue, on pharmaceutical issues, food. You know, so we are moving in the direction to increase that, because there are some projections that in the next 10, 15 years India may become the third-largest economy in the world if it continues to grow. Because one of the reasons they are growing is because of the domestic consumption, because it is not export-oriented, but the domestic demand is so huge. They are looking for special products and more products to enjoy their higher standard of living. \r\n So this is what India looks like, the traffic jam, you know, if you go there, because the infrastructure is a huge problem in India. And this is going to add more. This is what I was talking about, Tata’s Nano car, which is sold there for 2,500 (dollars) for Indian currency is the one – (inaudible). People had lined up when Tata had announced that. This is like your Smart car here, a little smaller. This will replace those motorscooters or motorcycles where they travel with a family of four. \r\n Now, India, although we have given you kind of a rosy picture, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. And I think Aileen mentioned World Bank, their “Doing Business” 2009 report; you know, they do – they do survey 181 countries in the world and then rank each one of them. You know, the number-one best country in the survey was Singapore; that means it is easy. And the United States is number four. And in that rank, you can see India is 122. So it is not very high, but I think every year I look at it, they are improving in some cases, not all. I think there is a list of doing business in India, starting a business, dealing with licenses. Because India still has a lot of government bureaucracy and license requirements, but I think they are moving in the direction, because they realize if they don’t open up and liberalize and change their regulations, they are not going to attract more investment and they are going to – not going to get a better quality product. \r\n And so there are services available from India Business Center that if you are looking for market research report or trade events or trade leads. And we also have free-trade agreement, because we don’t have one with India but we have, what, 14 other countries in the world that if you are doing business, we can provide you information. So if you don’t remember anything what I say, remember one thing, the phone number, which is a toll-free number and it is answered live at Trade Information Center, and that is 1-800-usa-trade. \r\n And this is what the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Commercial Service, the – what we can do. If you are in St. Louis, I think the first person you want to see and contact is Margaret or her staff because these are our trade specialists. And we have trade specialists in trade, the Export Assistant Center throughout the country, wherever you are – you live. So that is – (inaudible). \r\n And if you don’t know where to call, you can always go to export.gov or call us at 1-800-usa-trade. So we can help you to locate international buyers, distributors, agents, and also deal with your specific problems that you encounter in exporting process. So we help you to enter new markets much faster and make more profit. \r\n So that is basically what the India Business Center is, and it is – we are here to help you. So if you have any questions, give us a call or contact me personally or call 1-800 number. We have several trade specialists here who will be too happy to answer the questions. \r\n So I want to take this opportunity to thank Margaret again and for all of you for joining us for this webinar. Thank you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you, Aileen and Abdul. \r\n And at this time our operator, Julie (sp), will explain how participants of the webinar can get into a queue and ask their questions live to either Aileen or Abdul. Also, if you have typed a question in the question box, my colleague Matt will alternate with some of the live questions on prompt from me so that those questions are addressed as well. If by chance we don’t get to your question either verbally or written, please send us an e-mail and we will make sure that you get an answer to your question. \r\n Julie (sp), if you could please explain how the Q\u0026amp;A queue works. \r\n OPERATOR: Thank you. (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n One moment please to see if we have a question. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: While we’re waiting for people to queue for a live question, Matt, do we have any questions from the Q\u0026amp;A box? \r\n STAFF: Yeah. In the services area, do you see Indian developers and corporations leveraging U.S. architects for design and delivery of buildings? \r\n MS. NANDI: I – I’ll take that one. Yes, certainly. There’s been a number of high-profile buildings designed by U.S. architects. \r\n But I should mention, you know, I talked before about pricing, a key factor. You’re looking at blue chips or, you know, name-brand companies who are able to afford the services of U.S. architects. Also, architecture is a field where joint collaboration is very much needed. So the successful architecture firms that are doing business in India are doing some work from the U.S. and then they’re working with a local firm, you know. And that definitely helps, you know, in terms of navigating building codes, getting the approvals done and things like that. But yes, there’s a definite demand for that. \r\n So the building and construction sector has seen a little bit of a downturn, of course, with the economic – with the recession. You know, Indian companies are being, you know, cautious, of course, in terms of, you know, large capital expenditures. But in terms of a long-term trend, we definitely see this as a – as an opportunity for U.S. architecture firms. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. \r\n Operator, are there any questions? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes. I do have a question over the phone. Vishal Hurrik (ph), your line is open. \r\n Q: Yes. I’d like to know regarding the construction that is supposed to be happening in India, I think that there’s a lot of people that need jobs over there. But with the U.S. market being as – you know, as bad as it is, it seems a lot of people in India don’t have any jobs right now. \r\n How is it that that’s an increase if they want to build new highways and get hospitals and get more medical equipment and all the other things and stuff you talked about? How will that – you know, where will the infrastructure for that come from with such a bad economy in the U.S. and all over the world? \r\n MS. NANDI: Abdul, do you want to take that one? \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Yeah. I think you can understand the question that the infrastructure development in India is much – you know, much more progressively moving along than in the United States. You know, there are a lot – for example, there are a lot of construction workers in Dubai from India who (worked ?), and now they are being called back because the construction boom in Dubai has gone down. \r\n So there is still a lot of road building. You know, there are – a lot of smaller city airports are being built. The railway expansion is taking place. In fact, you know, there are thousands – (inaudible) – highways they have completed, but they are smaller. \r\n And then they’re also building housing, because there’s a large number of – you know, the middle class is demanding better housing even though – you know, not many homes, but these are the apartments that are being built. \r\n So they are looking for architectural service, design services, because they have enough labor force there. You know, despite all that, there is still high unemployment. There’s a large scale educated population, too. So the construction activities of hospitals, building bridges and roads is going on much larger scale than in the United States or Europe. \r\n Q: Thank you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Operator, do we have another question? \r\n OPERATOR: Right now I show no further questions over the phone. (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n One moment please. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Matt, I do believe we have more questions from the Q\u0026amp;A box. \r\n STAFF: Yes. When in March is the mission going, and where in India are they going? And on top of that, is it necessary to attend the entire week? \r\n MS. NANDI: Yes. The medical trade mission is – it’s in March. I want to say – I don’t have the exact dates off the top of my head, but I can send out information to you. It’s going to New Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai. \r\n And yes, you need to at least pay for the entire trade mission fee. But if you drop out of one city, you know, we can’t force you to go to all three cities. But you do need to sign up for the – for the entire package. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. \r\n Matt, is there another question in the Q\u0026amp;A box. \r\n OPERATOR: I do have another question. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Oh, okay. Go ahead, Julie (sp). \r\n OPERATOR: Jeff Jane (ph), your line is open. \r\n Q: Thank you. I just wanted to know for an architecture firm that wants to establish operations in India, what location or geography of India would be most suitable to provide design services to local developers and Indian corporations in the retail, commercial office space and hospitality, doing government work or those kinds of areas – and knowing that we also have a potential partner in Bangalore? Thank you. \r\n MS. NANDI: Most of the architecture and construction firms are located in Delhi and Mumbai. But this is really a sector where it doesn’t matter as much because so much is happening throughout the entire country. So if you have a local partner in Bangalore, it probably, you know, makes sense for you to consider that, you know, that area. \r\n This sector is also kind of regionalized. So, you know, one of the leading architecture firms, for example, in Calcutta, where I was, covers most of the high-end buildings in east India and also doing, you know, international projects. So you can have, you know, high achievers in cities outside Delhi, Mumbai. \r\n Q: Thanks. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Matt, is there another question from the Q\u0026amp;A box? \r\n STAFF: Can you guys talk more about the prospects for U.S. franchising businesses in India? \r\n MS. NANDI: Oh, thank you for that question. I’m trying to lead efforts to help U.S. franchising companies. That’s the sector that – where we see tremendous potential, because Indians are very entrepreneurial. And, of course, the franchising model makes a lot of sense because they’re using tried and true practices that were successful in other markets in India. \r\n Also, the organized retail sector is really booming in India, you know, in terms of malls and grocery stores, which have really only turned up in the past five to 10 years. So, of course, that gives a way for, you know, the commercial space for many franchises. So we see tremendous potential for food franchises, education franchises, health and wellness franchises and other types of services. So I’d be happy to talk to you offline to find out what – which area you’re working on and if it makes sense for you to come to India right now. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Julie (sp), do we have another question? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes, I do have a couple more questions over the phone. \r\n The next question comes from Vishaw Parat (ph). Your line is open. \r\n Q: Yes. This is for Dr. Shaikh and also a little bit for Aileen. Just being a freight forwarder, where does our role play, as I’m a freight forwarder and I do a lot of (moving ?). I have – and I have agents in India who I do deal with, and we are freight forwarders and do a lot of exports from here to India. I’d like to know what kind of role could I play in the business that you guys are in of trading stuff from India to – from the U.S. into India. \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Yeah. Very often when people call us that – they are looking for a freight forwarder because they don’t want to directly export themselves because there are documentations needed, (customs ?) clearances. You know, so the freight forwarder becomes a useful service to consummate the deal. And so we always refer them, the freight forwarders. We can’t identify one trade partner and prefer one over the other. So we do give them the contact information. \r\n Q: Thank you very much. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from George Conway (sp). Your line is open. \r\n Q: Thank you. I’ll ask this in general. I also sent it in writing, so you can ignore that. \r\n First of all, I really have two questions, and that is: What are the opportunities in the Indian dairy market for American products? \r\n And then, two, what is your working relationship with the Food Export Association? \r\n MS. NANDI: We actually don’t handle any agricultural products at all, because those are handled by the U.S. Agricultural – USDA and specifically the Foreign Agricultural Service. \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MS. NANDI: I do know it’s very – there’s very little potential for U.S. dairy products because India has such onerous requirements and they have a lot of restrictions, which is really bad for me because I love ice cream and you can’t get good ice cream. I would love to have Haagen-Dazs or Ben and Jerry’s in India. \r\n But Holly Higgins is the person to talk to in India. And I can – if you send me an e-mail, I can give you her contact information. \r\n Q: Okay. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: And right now I show no further questions over the phone. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Are there any further questions in the Q\u0026amp;A box? \r\n STAFF: Yes, there are. What will be spent on infrastructure, over the next couple of years, in India? \r\n MR. SHAIKH: I think the latest budget I saw infrastructure, if you include road, highways, the airports, public transportation, they were talking something to – in the neighborhood of 200 (billion dollars) to $400 billion. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. \r\n Matt, is there another question in the Q\u0026amp;A box? \r\n STAFF: Yes. Is there an appetite in this downturn for Indian corporations to use real estate space optimization services? \r\n MS. NANDI: I’m not familiar with that concept. Could you just briefly explain what you mean by that? \r\n STAFF: That I’m not sure. I’d have to get more details for you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Would the person that asked that question perhaps get into the queue with the live queue so that you could explain your question, please? \r\n OPERATOR: One moment. \r\n Jeb James (ph), your line is open. \r\n Q: Hi. You know, I asked that question regarding the real estate space optimization services, (instead of James ?). What it basically implies is, you know, when there is so much vacancy available in different parts of the world and the U.S. also, companies want to find a way to account for it in their balance sheets under the occupancy-expense area. \r\n In India, is there something like that on a balance sheet that companies worry about? And are they – are they – is that something that – you know, that our processes are – (inaudible) – that people have blocked here in the U.S.? Would they be interested in leveraging those services? \r\n MR. SHAIKH: I’m not sure. You know, generally the vacancy space are very low in India, because there is so much demand. And the – with the demand from both private sector – increasingly from private sector is so huge, and the land area is limited. So every bit of it is being used for construction and, therefore, the vacancy rates are relatively low – (inaudible) – in cities – of course, except in rural India where some construction projects are being abandoned for lack of funds. \r\n Q: Thank you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Julie (sp), are there any more questions in the – in the queue? \r\n OPERATOR: Right now I show no further questions in the queue. (Gives queuing instructions.) One moment please. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Don’t be shy. We have two experts available for your questions. \r\n I believe we have another question from the chat box, Matt? \r\n STAFF: Yes. Are there any opportunities for a U.S. manufacturer of high-quality party and decoration staples at a commensurate price point? \r\n MS. NANDI: That would probably be a tough sector because, again, this is a sector where there’s a lot of cheaply made goods from China and even locally made in India. So you’re probably looking at a very niche area of, you know, the – you know, the upper-middle class, the wealthy people who would want high-quality decorations. But I think this would be a sector that would be a little bit harder to penetrate in India. \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Yeah. I think just to add what Aileen said, you know, the top four – you know, four of the top 10 billionaires are living now in India. And some of those high-income brackets, they spend so much money lavishly during the birthdays and the wedding parties for, you know, the Indian people who are rich, fabulously rich. So it may be a very small market but it may be a very good market if you can find the niche for those people who are looking for it and they are looking for, you know, high-class products to have a (blast ?) of the party. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. \r\n Any other questions, Julie (sp)? \r\n OPERATOR: I show no further questions. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Any other questions, Matt? \r\n STAFF: That’s all that I have. \r\n OPERATOR: I do have another question over the phone. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Okay. Very well. We’ll take it. \r\n OPERATOR: Richard, your line is open. \r\n Q: Thank you. I’m an acoustics consultant and work in the design of cultural facilities, theaters, concert halls, things like that. And I was in India exploring the potential for the market there, and I was wondering if the speakers have any insight on whether there’s an expectation to be building this type of building in the near future. \r\n Also, another question: We noticed that the – India’s number 180, 181 in the World Bank information about honoring contracts. And, you know, if you have any hints on how we could structure a relationship, I would appreciate it. Thank you. \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Aileen, do you want to take that? \r\n MS. NANDI: Sure. On honoring contracts, this is where it would be essential to have a local law firm either approve or, you know, provide input on the contract that you’re signing, because they would better understand the Indian regulations, and they would also understand the – I don’t want to say “tricks” but they’d also understand the methods of operation that Indian companies employ at times. Because U.S. companies take a very straightforward approach in terms of doing business, whereas in India there’s sometimes this invisible dynamic that it’s always hard to put your finger on. But, you know, so this is – again, having a local partner and having a local lawyer either write or review the contract would be very helpful. \r\n Could you just repeat the first question again, please? I lost my train of thought. \r\n Q: Yes. I – we are acoustics and audio consultants, and we design cultural facilities like theaters and concert halls. And I’m wondering what the long-term market looks like for the construct – design and construction of such buildings. We note that India has very, very, very few facilities and seats per capita compared to other developed countries. And we think there’s a need, but we were wondering about your thoughts. \r\n MR. SHAIKH: As the income increases there, they are becoming more and more aware of the need for higher-level cultural facilities. You know, I mean, India produces the largest number of films, the Bollywood. \r\n Q: Right. \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Now we have Hollywood and Bollywood collaboration. And, you know, the – (inaudible) – invested $500 million in Hollywood. So they are, you know, trying to build more of those kind of facilities, especially the music and entertainment, where the middle class and higher-income groups can enjoy the acoustic level of the advanced increases that we are used to. \r\n Q: Very good. Thank you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: I’d like to remind everybody that I am going to send out the contact information for our speakers, the PowerPoints and a link to the recording probably on Tuesday of next week. We’re getting into some really specific questions, so for – but we do want to give everybody an opportunity to ask their questions. So for those of you that do not have a question or don’t have a specific question, we are recording the Q\u0026amp;A session as well. I just wanted to make sure that people get a chance to answer their questions, but some of them may not apply to everyone. \r\n Any more questions, Julie (sp)? \r\n OPERATOR: I show no further questions over the phone. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Matt, are there any more in the Q\u0026amp;A? \r\n STAFF: Yes. What is the market for concrete papers? \r\n MS. NANDI: There is a solid – a very good market for this, but this is something where I would have to do more market research to find out whether the current papers are locally made or brought in from, you know, China or other low-cost countries. So, yeah. Let me – if the person who asked this question could send me an e-mail, I’d be happy to get more information for you on that. \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Yeah. If I can mention to you that – you know, I told you that India Business Center has lot of market research reports based on our thinking in India as to what would be the best prospects for American companies. But if you have a product and if you want to explore whether there is a market for it, I think, you know, our folks in India, you know, as Aileen mentioned, that if you – if you contact Margaret or directly contact one of us, we will be glad to explore the possibility of those markets and get back to you. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. \r\n I think there’s another question in the chat box, in the Q\u0026amp;A box. \r\n STAFF: Yes. You discussed and mentioned roads, airports, rail, et cetera in the infrastructure budget, but there was no mention of water or wastewater. What is the value money to be spent on water and wastewater in India? \r\n MR. SHAIKH: Don’t think we have that number, you know, offhand. \r\n MS. NANDI: I don’t know the number off the top of my head, but we could get it – get it for you. This is a tricky – there’s a lot of opportunity here, but again, the financing for it can be – can be tricky. This is one area where the villages – there’s a lot of potential in the villages. Villages are, you know, putting together very unique mechanisms to pay for and implement wastewater treatment and, you know, water-purification technologies. These projects would be – would be very small in size, but some of the – some of the different projects that they’re doing are very, very innovative. \r\n So, again, if the person who asked this question could shoot me an e-mail, we could send you more details on that. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Thank you. \r\n Any more questions in the operator queue? \r\n OPERATOR: I show no questions over the phone. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Any more questions in the Q\u0026amp;A box? \r\n STAFF: That was the last one that I have. \r\n MS. GOTTLIEB: Having no more questions, I’d like to thank Aileen and Abdul again for their expertise and sharing their presentations with us and being available for the Q\u0026amp;A. As mentioned earlier, I will send out the materials to you on Tuesday. I’d like to thank everyone for participating in the webinar, and we look forward to working with you. We’ll end the webinar at this time.

You can expect this early next week. \r\n Move to another slide, a quick one. Let me know queue-up Mr. Hill for the presentation on NAFTA benefits. Tony, the floor is yours. \r\n Anthony Hill: Thank you, Roza. Thanks very much. I wanted to show everyone this slide here. Now we’re back to my presentation. Thanks very much, Roza. Great colleague, the Trade Information Center is a great resource. \r\n All of the participants today hopefully you know about that. It’s a place that you can call or assistance. You can also contact your local trade specialist, the one that’s in your area for your region. \r\n So let’s get started with talking about NAFTA and I really appreciate all of you for joining us today. NAFTA is a very important agreement for the United States and I think most Americans have heard of NAFTA but I would say most of them also don’t know very many details about the agreement. \r\n So this is a general agenda. We’re going to cover some general information about FTAs and NAFTA and then we’re going to talk about researching opportunities and then talk about the tariff-free benefits in NAFTA. \r\n And the reason I mentioned researching is because in order to take advantage of any international trade opportunity, it takes doing some research so I’d like to go over a little bit of how to do that in my presentation but here is a list of the free trade agreements that are currently in force for the United States. \r\n A lot of people don’t realize that we have all of these different agreements including the most recent agreements that were included with the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic and then also Oman and with Peru as well. \r\n You may have heard in the news a lot about the agreements with Panama, Columbia and South Korea that are currently pending. New one, and I want to talk a little bit about how the difference in trade with free trade agreement countries so here I’ve just pulled up some quick numbers and there’s 2009 trade volume in billions of dollars compared to 2010. \r\n Now of course with the recession, international trade and U.S. exports had decreased in 2008 and slightly increased in 2009 but you can see from ’09 to ’10 with all these free trade agreement countries that U.S. exports has increased substantially and you can see the percent change on the right. \r\n Now with NAFTA opportunities, Canada and Mexico are very important trading partners for the United States and that’s why NAFTA is so important. Trade with Canada and Mexico has increased substantially. \r\n You can see some of those numbers here like from 1993 to 2009, trade has increased 154% and then well, exports, let’s say total merchandise trade has increased 154% and 151% and then what is NAFTA? \r\n NAFTA provides what most people think of which is tariff rate elimination but NAFTA also includes a lot of other benefits and agreements, sections on different aspects of international business and trade. \r\n There is a special agreement on automobiles. There is a special agreement on textiles. There are special sections on energy and petrochemicals on agricultural products, on protecting investments. \r\n So protecting U.S. investments in other countries and their investments in the U.S., telecommunication services, financial services, protecting intellectual property, sanitary measure like getting things inspected, Customs procedures, labor protections, vital mineral protection and so on. \r\n And so one thing I want to point out to people is that there is an office in the Department of Commerce called the Trade Compliance Center and their sole purpose and focus is to make sure that foreign countries abide by the agreements that they’ve signed with the United States. \r\n And so if you have a problem with access to a foreign country, with them not abiding by a particular part of an agreement, you can e-mail them or call them and in fact you can even fill-out a form online to have them help you with that problem. \r\n Now some common misconceptions about NAFTA is that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs are the same but we all keep our own tariff rates. We can change them as we like but so they’re not all starting at the same points. \r\n And also within NAFTA originating the one misconception is that if you purchase something in a NAFTA country then it automatically qualifies which is not the case. \r\n Another thing that people think a lot is that NAFTA certification is a mandatory. It’s not a mandatory certificate. It’s only - it’s a voluntary certificate - in order for you to not have to pay or for your customer to not have to pay duties in the other country. \r\n Now of course some things won’t qualify for NAFTA and so you would not provide the certificate if something doesn’t qualify and another misconception is that a producer is required to supply a buyer with a certificate of origin now. \r\n It’s not required but of course any good producer or seller of a product is going to want to make their customer happy and providing a certificate of origin for a qualified product can help your customer avoid paying extra money for those duties. \r\n Let’s go back one slide, okay. Now I want to talk - (advantages) - now taking advantage of NAFTA - let’s go back to that - taking advantage of NAFTA starts with market research as I mentioned and I want to talk a little bit quickly about the Commercial Service if you don’t know what we can do for you. \r\n And then the next thing to know about is qualifying your product for NAFTA and then filling-out the documentation for your customer. Now the Commercial Service has a network of offices located throughout the U.S. so there is an office close to you that covers your location. \r\n And then we’re affiliated with our offices in 80-plus countries worldwide which are associated with the U.S. Embassies and (confids) and we work in concert with those offices, with those foreign commercial officers to support U.S. exports so we also have a lot of other local support like district export councils and regional teams. \r\n Now here are some of the services that the Commercial Service offers. One is export counseling. We do training. We do trade missions. We do market research. We have - we support - trade shows and gold key service which is a partner-matching service. \r\n So in doing market research, one great resource is going to be export.gov and within this Website there is a really wide range of information to support your market research and finding markets for your products so here is the market research section and there’s a market research library. \r\n Now I’ve pulled-up all the reports for Mexico because we were talking about NAFTA. When you pull-up a country - you pull-up the research for a particular country - the first thing that comes up is going to be a country commercial guide which is a very comprehensive guide to doing business and exporting to that country. \r\n It includes many things including trade regulations, information on the best sectors for U.S. exports and then contact information. There’s a slide showing the different chapters that are normally within a country commercial guide. Then also there are sector or industry-specific research reports that you can find. This happens to be one for household appliances in Mexico. \r\n Now these are written - these guides and this research - is written by our industry experts that are located in the country so they’re not, you know, people sitting in the U.S. studying a foreign industry but they’re in the country and they are local experts in that industry. \r\n And here’s another one which is unique. It’s research on selling to the Mexican petroleum company which you can imagine has its own set of difficulties and things to know. \r\n So this is the type of research that you can find. It can really be helpful to you. Now also obviously online there are going to be so many other sources for market research. I wanted to give you some more just to get you going. \r\n One that I like is World Bank and their doing business series. They have their own series of research and information on doing business in different countries and it’s always very informative. \r\n Then there are other things like the International Monetary Fund, TIA world fact book, and there’s so many sources but I recommend first finding out which countries are best for your products and if you’re focused on Canada and Mexico then the other thing to know is which products would be good for those markets. \r\n Now I’d also like to talk a little bit about trade data and here are a list of free resources for trade data so you can see where your product’s being shipped to or sold to and you can even figure out what the average price is going to those countries. \r\n Then also there are fee-based resources and those are often a little bit more comprehensive and more sort of manipulatable so you can sort of move the data around and use it in different ways so now you’ve got a flavor of the market research and what some resources you can use for that. \r\n Now for NAFTA and for other free trade agreements, while there are those other sections, what most people think of and what most people want to know about is how to take advantage of the tariff benefits and this is what we’ll talk about for the rest of this session. \r\n Now the tariff rate benefits I mean, within NAFTA mean paying zero tariffs and there are basically four steps here: determining the HS code which is important to know anytime you’re involved in international trade; determining whether there is actually a tariff benefit - you’ll see what I mean by that - in just a minute; determining whether the product qualifies; and then certifying that the product qualifies. \r\n Now one thing I want to note to begin with is that if a product is entirely U.S. content, it automatically qualifies. Okay, so what is an HS code? It’s a six to 10-digit number. There are other terms that are sort of used for this number and like a Schedule B number, HTS code, harmonized tariff code. \r\n The Schedule B is really the U.S. export specific codes but they’re based on the HS system. Now it’s a number that’s used to categorize products and generally speaking throughout the world it’s a system that’s used throughout the world. \r\n You can look-up your Schedule B number for export code at census.gov under export codes or you can call them and have them help you figure out what your code is for your products. \r\n Now the HS code - I want to go back to the trade data - the HS code is also important in trade data and important anytime you’re doing international trade. A lot of documents require the HS code so here’s one example of an HS code for ball-point pens and I just want to point out the different terms that are used when talking about the HS code. \r\n One term is a chapter. The chapter is a very general category that is just the first two digits so even if it’s a 02 - 02 is the chapter - and then also there’s a term which is heading and the heading is the first four digits and subheading is the first six digits so those are really - the first six digits - are the numbers that are harmonized internationally that are supposed to be identical. \r\n When you get to the eight or 10-digit level, those are the more-specific subcategories that countries can use to - well they can use those numbers - to create their own subcategories so at the 10-digit level, the U.S. code could and probably is different than the Canadian and Mexican codes but if you get the six digits, that should be sufficient for most purposes. \r\n Now once you’ve determined the HS code, the next step is to determine whether there is actually a tariff benefit and what I mean by that is that sometimes a product may be duty-free going to a country whether it qualifies for the free trade agreement or not. That means so wherever it’s coming from, it’s duty-free. \r\n A lot of times like for example that might be true of IT products. I’ve noticed that things like servers and computers are often duty-free so in those cases there wouldn’t necessarily be a benefit to figuring out your NAFTA qualification. \r\n There are a couple of exceptions. Right now there is a dispute going on between the United States and Mexico regarding allowing Mexican trucks in the United States and so Mexico has some retaliatory duties on certain products so even though the product may qualify under NAFTA, it may still not be duty-free. \r\n And also Mexico has a Customs fee of .8% so if the product qualifies under NAFTA, you would not have to pay this .8% and that means that even though let’s say it’s a computer going to Mexico and it does qualify under NAFTA, the computer may be duty-free coming from anywhere. \r\n And so there may not actually - so like there’s no duties - on the computer but the Customs fee would still apply if you don’t do the NAFTA certificate so if that .8% is worth it to you, then you could do the NAFTA certificate for that computer and not have to pay that fee. \r\n So basically you’re just comparing what the normal rate is which is sometimes referred to as the MFN rate, Most Favored Nation. That’s just the rate that applies to products from other countries so you compare that rate versus the 0% NAFTA rate and if they’re the same, then there’s no extra benefit except for the Mexican Customs fee. \r\n Now if you’ve determined that there is a benefit to you, then the next step is to determine whether your product does qualify. Now this is going to be the most complicated and please write down your questions when you have them and ask them at the end because this is what we get the most questions about and what people have the most problems with. \r\n Now within NAFTA and a lot of, well, a lot of other free trade agreements there are things called preference criteria. Now the preference criteria is just a statement saying how your product does qualify for the benefits of this agreement. \r\n Now generally speaking, trade agreements, they will have these three main categories, this A, B and C. These are the preference criteria. Now A is almost, well, I would say A is normally reserved for agricultural products and natural resources. \r\n Now one thing I know that sometimes when you read these, they sort of all sound the same and it’s hard to distinguish them from each other but just know that A is normally for agricultural products and natural resources. \r\n And, well, that’s because what A is looking for or the things that qualify under A are those things for which you can trace back the raw materials to raw materials that came from the region like the U.S., Canada or Mexico. \r\n So for most machinery like machinery and parts and things like that, it’d be very difficult to trace those back to the raw materials and you wouldn’t want to do that anyway because, you know, it wouldn’t be necessary but for certain things you probably could and you could use Criterion A. \r\n Now C, C is a manufactured product where all of the parts and materials but not necessarily the raw materials but all the parts and let’s say processed materials did come from the U.S., Canada or Mexico. \r\n When that happens, those parts - let’s say the part was created in the U.S., then another part’s created in Canada - both of those parts are considered originating meaning they come from the region and remember at the beginning of this section I stated that if something is all U.S. content, then it automatically qualifies and so you see that note here also. \r\n Now the difficulty comes when you have foreign materials incorporated into your product. If you do have that, then that’s when you need to determine whether your product qualifies and if it does, you would use preference Criterion B. \r\n Now there are other preference criterions but they are very specific and used only in very specific circumstances and I can definitely help you with those if you need that so you can just send me an e-mail if you have specific questions about the other preference criterion. \r\n Okay. Now with NAFTA, a product with foreign inputs uses preference Criterion B but that means that you have to look-up the rule of origin that applies to your specific product. \r\n Now this one difference between NAFTA and certain other free trade agreements, in NAFTA the rules of origin are very product-specific. The rule for one product may be different than the rule for another product. \r\n Now here right here I’m showing you the different things that could be included in a rule of origin under NAFTA so A is it may require a change in the HS code from the imported part to the finished product that you are exporting. \r\n So the imported part of material is going to come in under a certain HS code and the rule may require that as it’s incorporated that the final exported product be under a different HS code and it may be a requirement that it be under a different chapter, a different heading or a different subheading so that is going to be specific in the rule. \r\n And then also the rule of origin may require a minimum regional value content and what I say is may is because some rules have just the HS code change requirement. Some rules have just the regional value content and some have both and we’ll go over these in more specific detail in a minute. \r\n Now the rules of origin originally were in Annex 401 of the agreements. You can look that up if you like but actually it’s better to look-up the most recent version but sometimes things get updates. \r\n Rules have been updated over time and the U.S. International Trade Commission keeps the updated rules of origin for all of the free trade agreements and those are in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S. Now NAFTA is under General Note 12T and you can also get to information on this through export.gov. \r\n Now remember what you want to do is look for the heading or the subheading which encompasses the heading or subheading of your product so a lot of times it won’t - the rule of origin - if you’re looking up on the list of rules, it may not say your specific HS code but there will be a heading or a range so you want to look for the range within which your product would fit. \r\n Now here is an example which I think is pretty simple and hopefully will illustrate what you might need to do and this is cupcakes and we’re going to assume that all of the inputs for these cupcakes were imported. \r\n Now the first step is finding an HS code which is 1905.90. The second step is looking-up the rule of origin, you know, I mean, obviously if these were all U.S. inputs they would automatically qualify but because they’re all imported, we need to look at the rule of origin. \r\n The rule of origin for this HS code says a change to 1905 from any other chapter. Now all of the rules are going to be worded similarly to this meaning that in a way it’s kind of cryptic but what it’s saying is the imported material or parts have to change to 1905 which is the code for the exported product from any other chapter. \r\n Now again there’s going to be a lot of variation but what it’s saying is that the imported material has to change to this exported code from something. Now here’s the interpretation at the bottom. \r\n The cupcakes can qualify if all of the imported components are not from Chapter 19, right, because it says from any other chapter. Okay, here we have the materials that went into making the cupcakes and I’ve only provided the HS codes to the four-digit level of the heading just so you can see that each one of these inputs is not from Chapter 19. \r\n Now Chapter 19 is it’s basically baked goods as you can see and none of these inputs are going to be baked goods so these products, these exports would qualify under NAFTA because they meet the rule of origin requirements. \r\n Now here’s a little more difficult example and this is one that is a real example that I had got from a company. I worked with them on helping them qualify. This is garden umbrellas. \r\n Now I think sometimes maybe looking at rules of origin like this can be sort of intimidating because of all the numbers that are there and you’re not sure what all these numbers mean but my best advice is to take it step by step and just look-up the numbers. It’s not too difficult if you go to that Census Bureau Website to just look-up those numbers. \r\n Now the HS code for the umbrellas is 6601.10 and this says a change to this. This is the exported product so the parts have to change to this exported product from any other heading - remember, the heading is the four digits - except it cannot be from a combination of both of these categories below. \r\n So what does that mean? A, it can’t be a combination of 6603.20 and all these headings below that after B and what, you know, I think what the heck does that mean, right? \r\n Now if you look-up those codes, it actually becomes more clear. 6603.20 which is after A is an umbrella frame. All of those codes or those headings after the letter B are umbrella parts so all this is saying is that you can’t have an umbrella frame that’s foreign and umbrella parts and then combine those into the exported garden umbrella and have that qualify. \r\n So if you think of that in other words is that you can’t just bring in the frame and the parts and do the assembly in the U.S. and have it qualify. Either the frame or the parts must be a U.S. product in order for it to qualify. I hope I make that clear. \r\n But I wanted to show you different examples to give you a feel for what you may encounter when you’re looking at the rules of origin and here’s another one. I think this is a little simpler. It’s the ball-point pens. \r\n We looked at this HS code earlier and it just talks about a change to this subheading because this is a little different at the subheading level. Remember it may be a range and so here’s a range where ball-point pens fall and it has to be from any other chapter. \r\n Now this one has two options in fact. You know, the first one is if the foreign material comes from another chapter, then it automatically qualifies now but then there’s an exception which is letter B. \r\n If there is some foreign material that comes from other - that is not from another chapter - then you can still qualify if you have a certain amount of value added in the U.S. You know, and I can’t explain why the different rules are the way they are. This is just the way the agreement was negotiated. \r\n Now what does this mean? Now Chapter 96 is miscellaneous manufactured articles, subheading 9608.60 is refills for pens and 9608.99 is other pen parts so I’m going to go back real quick. Remember, there’s refills for pens and other pen parts. \r\n Under B, this range of 9608.60 through 9608.99, the parts can be from that range which as you can see is within the same Chapter of 96 but if they are then you have to have this regional value content meaning that a certain amount of value from the U.S. \r\n Now what does that mean? That means that if the refill for the pen and the pen parts are not from the U.S., it can still qualify if the product - the final exported pen - has enough value added in the U.S. \r\n Now under NAFTA qualification we talked a little bit about the regional value content. When that is included, you will always have the option of using the transaction value or the net cost and the thresholds for these will always be the same. \r\n Now it is your choice, you can use whichever one best enables you to qualify and so at this point, you get to where you have these formulas and it’s, you know, some people - they’re intimidated by, you know, having to do a calculation - but really this is just a matter of figuring out what the percent value is from the U.S. \r\n So under transaction value, you’re starting at a higher point which is the transaction value and you’re taking out - subtracting any - the value of non-originating materials which is just the foreign materials but it’s foreign materials that are not from Canada and Mexico so if it’s Canada and Mexico, it still would qualify as a domestic or a regional material. \r\n That’s why they call it the regional value content so subtracting the non-originating materials from the transaction value and then what is left over? What is left over as a percentage of the transaction value? You know, that threshold is 60% so if it’s 60% or more then the product does meet that regional value content. \r\n And then the other method is the net cost where you would add-up the costs of production. You can use almost all costs. There are certain ones which I’ll mention that you would not include but you can see here the threshold is lower and that’s because you’re not starting at that higher point. \r\n And here again you’re just subtracting out the value of the non-originating material and figuring out what the remainder is and what percentage that is of the net cost. \r\n Okay, so the transaction value is adjusted to an FOB basis which means you don’t include the duty whatever the duty would be then and the transportation across the border to the customer. \r\n And then the value of a non-originating material, if it’s not included it should include all the costs of that material including waste, including duties and taxes. You know, of course it would be to your advantage for this number to be smaller but they don’t want you to be taking out all kinds of costs that are real costs of the foreign products or the foreign materials. \r\n Now net cost, when you’re using net cost and building-up the costs involved in the material, there are certain things that you don’t include like sales promotion, marketing, after-sales service. You do take out shipping and packing costs. Packing is packing for shipment, not packaging for retail. \r\n Now within NAFTA and other free trade agreements, if you do have foreign material and the foreign material doesn’t qualify, there is a de minimus rule which allows up to 7% of the value to be non-qualifying material. \r\n That means that you add-up all the foreign parts that don’t qualify and if they all add-up to 7% or less of the value, then you can still qualify it but if the foreign inputs does not meet the specific rule of origin for your final product, then the final product doesn’t qualify and unfortunately that does happen once in awhile. \r\n I’ve had a few cases where, you know, there was quite a decent amount of value added in the United States but the problem was just that the HS code did not change from the imported part material to the exported part material and in that case, I mean, there’s really nothing you can do because the rule of origin is the rule of origin. \r\n Now certification. This is important. For NAFTA it’s required that you use a NAFTA certificate of origin. I mean, you can download this for free at export.gov. Cbp.gov also has these and even Canadian Border Services has their own version but it’s just the same in that you can download. Now the NAFTA certificate is a self-certification. \r\n That means you’re not sending it to our office to get stamped or signed or anything. It’s something that you’re certifying is true but it does need to be presented to the foreign Customs official so you send a copy to your buyer and I always recommend including a copy with all the paperwork that’s going with the shipment and then of course keep a copy for yourself. \r\n Now I want to go over the certificate of origin real quickly because we do get a lot of questions about this. We get questions about let’s see the blanket period. Hopefully you can see it’s sort of the box Number 2 on the right side. \r\n Now blanket period allows you to use this same - or allows your customer to use - this same document for multiple identical shipments and it can be valid for up to one year so you would put whatever date of your first shipment integration the from and the to one year from that date. \r\n You can make it less than a year if you would like but it’s just so you don’t have to fill-out a new certificate each time you make a shipment and I also get a lot of questions about the text identification number. \r\n You may not know the text ID number of your customer or the importer or the producer and that’s okay. They don’t really expect you to know everyone else’s text ID number necessarily. \r\n Next is Box 7. Box 7 is for the purpose criterion that we went over and it’s probably the one I get the most questions about. As you can see, Box 6 is the HS code so you’ll need to know that there of course. \r\n And then Box 8. Box 8 is really a yes-or-no question. A lot of times people aren’t sure about that but it’s basically just saying are you the producer and you put yes. If you’re not the producer, then you’re have to put a number code after the word no. \r\n The numbered code signifies how you know that the product does qualify so, you know, if you’re the producer, it’s assuming that you know because you know where the parts and the materials came from but if you’re not the producer, you know, they want to know, you know, how do you know? \r\n How do you know that this product qualifies so the different numbers indicate this. The Number 1, Number 1 indicates that you know based on just your own knowledge meaning you don’t have a document stating that from the producer. \r\n Note 2 - the 2 after that - says that or it means that you do have a document stating that it qualifies and this is from the producer but it’s not - the document is not - a signed NAFTA certificate and that’s okay too. That’s okay. \r\n Note 3 means that you do have a signed NAFTA certificate from the producer and as you can imagine, that is the safest way to go if you’re not the producer, just to be able to document that you have a certificate of origin. \r\n Net costs. Net costs always trips people up too. Net costs is it’s still kind of a yes-no question but the first answer, well, one option is no, you don’t and it’s really just asking whether you used the net cost calculation in order to qualify your product. Most of the time that’s going to be no. If you did use it, you’ll put NC and then after that is the country of origin which is self-explanatory. \r\n Okay, we’ve gone through the steps, certifying the product, it does qualify. A couple of things to know. It is required that the product is shipped directly from the U.S. or if it goes through a third country, it cannot leave Customs control and there are different ways you can do that. \r\n You can remain in a Customs warehouse or under bond or something like that but it cannot enter the commerce of the third country and then qualify under NAFTA. You should keep your records for at least five years. They can audit you up to five years back and Customs can seek information from both parties. \r\n I want to remind you market research is important and we can help you with that in the Commercial Service. If your product is all-U.S. then, you know, it automatically qualifies. You just need to know about their certificate of origin but if its’ got some foreign inputs, you know, you need to know how to qualify that. \r\n And here is my contact information and I think Dan do you have anything to add? \r\n Dan Duvall: Yes, just a couple of thoughts, Tony. Hello, everybody. Dan Duvall at the Trade Information Center in Washington. One thing that has helped me when you’re doing your calculations if you have to figure out original value content or net cost is to think of it as your ninth-grade algebra problem. \r\n Because it’s just the same kind of little formula that you used back then and it’ll help you to understand the calculation better and Tony I’m glad you clarified about the net cost because I get a lot of questions where people are confused in thinking that refers to the value of the product which it does not. \r\n It refers to whether or not you’re using a net cost methodology to calculate your... \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, that’s right. That’s a common misunderstanding on the form. People want to put a value there or something like that, yeah. \r\n Dan Duvall: Yeah, the only other thing I might mention is that on the country of origin if you’re doing it online or on a computer, a lot of software only recognize a two character for it so for the United States it’s just U.S. not USA and only other thing I’ll say is that people are also welcome to e-mail me. \r\n The e-mail format is the same as Tony’s except that my name is Dan dot D-U-V-A-L-L at trade dot gov and I’m in Washington, D.C. on the other side of the country from Tony and that’s all I had for now Tony but I’ll be glad to participate in the question-and-answer session too. \r\n Anthony Hill: Great. Operator, can we open it up for questions? \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, you may do so by pressing star 1 on your touch-tone phone. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly. Once again to ask a question, please press star 1 and record your name and it does just take a moment for that first question to come through. \r\n Roza Pace: Tony, can you hear me? \r\n Anthony Hill: I can. \r\n Roza Pace: Yeah. One question perhaps and by the way thank you so much for a wonderful presentation. As usual very useful and it was chock full of information and practical steps. \r\n Now in terms of small-value shipments, one of the most popular calls that we also get is do I really need to fill-out a NAFTA certificate if my shipment is let’s say only $500 or so? Can you comment on that? \r\n Anthony Hill: Oh yeah, yeah, and that’s a good point, that’s a good point. Yeah, Canada, well yeah, you’re allowed to do low-value shipments without filling-out the NAFTA certificate of origin. You just need to write on the commercial invoice that this product is NAFTA-qualified. Thanks for asking that question. \r\n Coordinator: And Tony we do have three questions from the phones if you’d like to take those. \r\n Anthony Hill: Okay, yes, thanks. \r\n Coordinator: (Participant), your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Hello, Tony. Thanks for the presentation. It was pretty informative for us. One of our questions is we have a compliance group within our company and they in the past have told us that only our compliance officer can sign the master certificates and we sense that this might be just a company rule because most of us have worked other places and we’ve all been able to sign these certs. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, yeah, that’s right. It sounds like a company rule and any official from a company could at least to Customs represent that that product qualifies. \r\n (Participant): Okay, can I ask one other follow-up question to the last caller? \r\n Anthony Hill: Sure. \r\n (Participant): What is the value for these low-cost invoices? As she said, is there a... \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, $2000. \r\n (Participant): Two thousand, okay, so anything below 2000 you can put on the invoice NAFTA-qualified if it is and you don’t have to do a cert? \r\n Anthony Hill: That’s right. \r\n (Participant): Okay, thank you. \r\n Coordinator: And our next question comes from (Participant). Your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Hi, Tony. \r\n Anthony Hill: Hi. \r\n (Participant): I have a question regarding the de minimus rule. I was just wondering, with using the de minimus rule would this product still fall under Criterion B? \r\n Anthony Hill: If it qualifies under - no - no no. That’s right. It would be under Criterion C. \r\n (Participant): Okay, so you would pretty much not consider that foreign material as anything that would change that? \r\n Anthony Hill: That’s right. \r\n (Participant): Okay. \r\n Anthony Hill: Because it’s not meeting the rule of origin but it’s not necessary because there’s a minimal amount of foreign materials. \r\n (Participant): Yeah, they give you some leeway. Well, thank you very much. \r\n Anthony Hill: You’re welcome. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Participant). Sir, your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Thank you. Real quick question, Tony. We get asked a lot to provide a NAFTA with the importer’s name as “various” and they don’t want to provide the text ID number because they’d like to use the NAFTA for multiple locations going north or going south and usually we push back and we try to limit it to one and get the actual importer with their tax ID. What is the position on using the word various for the importer? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, I would recommend against that. You know, I don’t think there’s a big risk to you as long as the product does qualify but, you know, I don’t know. To me it just seems like there’s no specific company that’s the importer then you don’t know what’s going on with the product but I don’t think there’s necessarily a bigger risk to you so I guess it would be okay but I would recommend against. \r\n (Participant): Thank you. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, you’re welcome. \r\n Roza Pace: Well Tony just FYI, the instruction page it allows one to do that various but I agree with your take on that. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yes. \r\n Coordinator: And Tony if you have time for one more question? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, sure. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Participant). Your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Hi. I had a quick question about the recordkeeping. I know you’re supposed to keep their certificate for five years but do you also need to keep the calculations, regional value content, tariff classification, how you came up with it in the recordkeeping as well or is that not necessary? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, if you have those, it definitely, you know, if you’re ever audited, it’s kind of like being audited by the IRS, right? You want to have all the records you can so it’s definitely better to keep those than to not have them. \r\n Roza Pace: And we also note this recently we get several number of calls from companies that when they put no one when they are not the producer and the information that they obtained for the qualification of product is based on their understanding or knowledge of the product, that might be potential red flag. \r\n A lot of companies are then asked within 10-day period or so to provide additional information. At least that’s an experience of last couple of weeks and I think maybe because Customs are looking more carefully to collect more revenue or we don’t know why but just to let you know that in this case is best to keep as much information as you can. \r\n (Participant): Thank you. \r\n Anthony Hill: You’re welcome. \r\n Roza Pace: Tony, I have a couple of questions here from the follow-ups that were typed. \r\n Anthony Hill: Okay. \r\n Roza Pace: Can we get more information concerning blanket period - you explained the blanket period - if you wouldn’t mind restating just very quickly what that is all about? \r\n Anthony Hill: The blanket period is just to allow you to use the same form for multiple shipments to the same customer so you’d fill-out the form as you normally would and send it to your customer and then put on the blanket period some period of up to one year and then you don’t have to keep sending the form to your customer. Your customer can reuse that same form. I hope that makes sense. \r\n Roza Pace: Yes, but I think that’s helpful. \r\n Anthony Hill: Anything else? \r\n Roza Pace: Now while we are waiting for additional questions, I want to thank everyone for tuning in today and we have a slide on the computer that you could look at the future upcoming Webinars. Tony actually is going to be our speaker for the next one, Cashing-in with Free Trade Agreements. \r\n As he indicated, we have quite a few of those and the rules of origin are FTA-unique and the documentation is different so for those of you who are looking at cashing-in with different FTA agreements, we strongly encourage that you look at those too. \r\n Then we also looking in April at Expert Filing Documents. That’s another very useful and popular Webinar using expert data to find market and price your products and the one in May that I’ll be hosting again is Using E-Commerce and Social Networking to Increase Your International Sales. \r\n Part of this Webinar will also be focusing on optimizing your Web presence. Operator, do you have any other questions perhaps? \r\n Coordinator: We do. We have about four more questions if you have time. \r\n Roza Pace: Tony, do you have enough time? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, I have. \r\n Roza Pace: Okay. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Participant). Your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Yes, I had a question regarding the importer and wanting to not - some people want to put various there - so we have a situation where we send literally thousands of products into a multiple number of customers which could be in the hundreds into Canada. \r\n Anthony Hill: Right. \r\n (Participant): So we do put importer various and a blanket period of a year and we supply that. We don’t supply the NAFTA cert with every shipment. We give it to our brokers who then... \r\n ((Crosstalk)) \r\n (Participant): ...so are you expecting people to create a NAFTA cert for every shipment if they’re putting in the actual importer? \r\n Anthony Hill: Well, no. I mean, obviously in your situation it makes sense for you to use various. \r\n Roza Pace: I agree, yeah. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, you know, it’s allowed. You know, there are certain parts of international trade or situations where you really do want to know who the customer is and what they’re going to be using it for and so I wouldn’t do it if it weren’t necessary for like in a situation like yours. \r\n Roza Pace: And if I may also add Tony too that sometimes folks ask us questions like this. I’m shipping number of products. Some of them are NAFTA-qualifying, others are not. They are on the same pallet, in the same big box. Can I should I put them on NAFTA certificate? Can you comment on that? \r\n Anthony Hill: Oh, no, yeah, yeah. We do get that question. That’s a good point and you definitely should not put the products that are not qualified on the NAFTA certificate. Just list the ones that are qualified. \r\n (Participant): This is a follow-up question I have if I’m still connected. We have some items that have no duties applied to them that they meet NAFTA requirements but there’s a zero duty assessed on them but we still get requests for NAFTA - so we do not supply - a NAFTA cert in that case? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. \r\n (Participant): But we still get requests for those NAFTA certs and people are very insistent. \r\n Anthony Hill: You know, I’ve heard that a lot too and the best I can say is, you know, keep your customers satisfied. I mean, if they really want one even though it’s not going to benefit them at all. \r\n (Participant): Right. I usually give them - here’s the HS number - it is duty-free. We do not provide NAFTS certs for these because I think sometimes... \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, if it’s a hassle for you, don’t worry about it. Just explain that it’s duty-free. Sometimes, you know, if the customer really insists, sometimes the customer really insists and I say well, you know, keep the customer happy, right? \r\n Roza Pace: And you know too to add to that too what Tony said that there might be occasional situations that customer you may be shipping a product or input to a larger product then in turn may have to be qualified for NAFTA and so you try to make sure that you either have NAFTA certificates for the components or you want to know where it originates so in this particular situation (Participant) you may want to comply if that’s not too much of a burden. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, you know, that’s true. You’re sending in input to a company and they want to know whether it’s qualified, that’s a good point. \r\n Roza Pace: That’s not a required one. We need to contact Canadian Customs about that question and they said it’s not required because in case, you know, you can ship the same product from China and you don’t have to do it so in a sense it would be like putting additional burden for U.S. exporter when you can ship it from China for free without the paperwork. \r\n So it’s only when you make sense and like Tony say sometimes you just do it because you want - customer wants it - and if it’s not so much, you do. \r\n (Participant): Yes. Thank you. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Participant). Your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Hi, Tony. One more question from our group. \r\n Anthony Hill: Okay. \r\n (Participant): It speaks to the various again but from the exporter side. We are the producer because we’re supply, we’re manufacturer and so right now when we drop ship for Mexican distributors into Laredo, we put various in the exporter section and the brokers in Laredo get really upset with us because they want us to be shown as the exporter of record. \r\n Anthony Hill: Okay. \r\n (Participant): So we only want to be shown as the producer so... \r\n Anthony Hill: Interesting. \r\n (Participant): Yeah. \r\n Anthony Hill: Do you have a U.S. entity that’s the exporter of record? Who’s the exporter of record? \r\n (Participant): Well, that’s the thing. Our logistics group wants us to turn it over to the Mexican distributor’s broker in Laredo and let them deal with it. \r\n Anthony Hill: Okay. \r\n (Participant): And just make us the producer for NAFTA purposes. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, well someone’s got to be filling-out the export documentation for you or for someone who is the exporter of record. \r\n (Participant): Right. \r\n Anthony Hill: Like is it the Customs broker? \r\n (Participant): Well, I assume the Mexican distributor gives a POA to the broker in Laredo and then I don’t know if he acts as agent on their behalf but our logistics group and compliance group doesn’t want us to show EGS our company as the exporter of record. They want to put various in there and we get pushback from brokers in Laredo that say fill it out the right way. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, well... \r\n (Participant): And we come back with we only want to be the producer. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, I guess the thing is to know who is on the other export documentation on aesdirect.gov. Who is filling that out and who is the exporter of record there whether it’s your company or whoever it is, I mean, if it’s your company that is in fact the exporter of record, then you’re the exporter. \r\n (Participant): Well, actually we do the filing as the U.S. PPI but we don’t want to become the exporter of record. \r\n Anthony Hill: Well, someone has to be, I mean. \r\n (Participant): Right, right, right, but it doesn’t fly sometimes to have various on there and if you don’t want to become the exporter of record, what do you put in that box? If you just want to certify... \r\n Anthony Hill: Well as a producer, yeah, if you’re just the producer, you are truly just the producer and not the exporter... \r\n (Participant): Yes. \r\n Anthony Hill: ...then I wouldn’t see a problem putting various... \r\n (Participant): Okay. \r\n Anthony Hill: ...for the exporter because you could have multiple exporters of record... \r\n (Participant): That’s right. \r\n Anthony Hill: ...and you’re just providing the documentation to the exporter who would then fill-out their own NAFTA certificates based on your documentation, yes. \r\n (Participant): Okay. We just wanted to clarify that. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. \r\n Man: But that’s only if you do consolidations, right? \r\n (Participant): Well, it would be for consolidations or single shipments, right? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yes. \r\n (Participant): Okay, depending on who we were shipping to in Mexico and who they appointed as a broker in Laredo. \r\n Anthony Hill: Right, right. \r\n (Participant): Okay, any other questions from our group? Thank you, Tony. \r\n Anthony Hill: Okay, you’re welcome. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Participant). Your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Hi, thank you again for such a great job in doing this. Mine is kind of a - I had one question originally - and then it brought up another question with one of the statements that you guys said. \r\n We’re just a packing and shipping company. We’re not the exporter. We’re not the importer. We’re not even a producer. I’m just a logistics person for shipping items back and forth at which point 99% of the time, the little people here in the U.S. they’re asking me to ship this elsewhere, Mexico or Canada. \r\n They don’t have certificate of origin because it’s either they’ve owned this for awhile or they just purchased it. An example would be a piano I just shipped into Mexico. Obviously it was made here in the U.S. \r\n I had a receipt from the store that they purchased it from but it all comes back to our Number 8, no Number 1 but at that point, you all said that if that happens, Customs is going to come after me saying where’s the document for proof? How often does that happen in situations like this? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, it could happen. \r\n (Participant): Because I have no way of proving it. It’s just based on what I’m being told. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. Is there any way for you to get documentation or an e-mail at least? \r\n (Participant): Besides the receipt, no. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, see you’re sort of setting yourself up for a bad situation I think because, I mean... \r\n Dan Duvall: You need supporting documentation. \r\n (Participant): Okay, so at that point you all are looking for more than just a receipt? You all are looking for a certificate of origin here that it was actually made in the United States and then I can put this with this NAFTA? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, something that’s saying that it qualifies. If you would keep the supporting documentation for yourself, for your records. \r\n (Participant): Right, right, okay. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yes. \r\n (Participant): Okay. That got brought up with you all’s statement earlier. My original question was if I’m using on Number 6 and 7 if I’m using just the regular Schedule B or HS code that you get on I normally go to the foreign trade Census Bureau and look under Schedule B. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, exactly. \r\n (Participant): This is not a problem, I get that, but Number 7, where do I find - let’s pretend I’m the piano going to Mexico - where would I find Number B, let’s pretend that the strings were made in Italy but the piano itself was made here, where do I find all that supporting documents that you were showing like for the ball-point pen and the umbrellas? \r\n Roza Pace: You mean the rules of origin, yeah? \r\n (Participant): Yes, yes, yes. Where do I find that information at? \r\n Anthony Hill: Well, you know, the next case is that’s what kind of makes it really going to be - it’s going to be really difficult - for you because you may have no contact with the producer at all, right? \r\n (Participant): Correct. I normally 99.9% of the time do not have any contact with the producers. \r\n Anthony Hill: So if I were you, I probably would avoid certifying that qualifies unless you can get in touch with the producer and have them at least send you an e-mail that it qualifies, some kind of document. \r\n (Participant): Okay. \r\n Roza Pace: And you know one thing yeah to remember is that made in the USA or made in Mexico does not necessarily mean the product qualifies. \r\n (Participant): Exactly which was what I was trying to find where the preference criterion in this (case) is. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, because that’s right. \r\n Roza Pace: Oh, the preference criterion you can find on the Website. Tony, you may want to comment on where it is, the rules of origin. \r\n Anthony Hill: The criteria’s on the Website and the rules of origin are at U.S. ITC but I think what you would need is to know what foreign materials are in the product and where they, you know, where they came from. \r\n (Participant): Where they came from. \r\n Anthony Hill: You know, and that’s going to be really hard for you to find out, I think. \r\n (Participant): Yeah, so I’m going to have to start shying away from these period because I don’t have seven and I don’t have eight. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. \r\n (Participant): What this boils down to is that because I don’t want to make mistakes and I’m certainly not letting Customs come after me because I don’t have all the details from a shipper. Is that what this is boiling down to? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. That’s right. \r\n (Participant): Just don’t do them? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, the shipper is going to have to take some responsibility to find out that information. \r\n (Participant): Okay. \r\n Anthony Hill: You know, I mean, we can help them. They can take one of these Webinars, something like that. \r\n (Participant): Or they can just call that I believe there was an 800 number... \r\n Anthony Hill: That’s right. \r\n (Participant): ...that they need to call and talk to you all about and have them come up with six, seven and eight and at that point then I can fill this out for them. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. \r\n (Participant): Is that what you recommend? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, I would recommend them taking the responsibility and figuring out what qualifies. \r\n (Participant): I like that. That’s happy. Brilliant. Thanks again for all of your all’s help. \r\n Anthony Hill: You’re welcome. \r\n Coordinator: Our next question comes from (Participant). Your line is open. \r\n (Participant): Hello. I have used the regional value content calculations in the past and I thought that you I heard you mention something that that might be an option rather than something that you could always use? How could I find out whether that option is available to me? \r\n Anthony Hill: That is within the specific rule of origin for your product so the rule of origin may allow the regional value content calculation or it may not. \r\n (Participant): Okay, so if... \r\n Anthony Hill: So you would find your HS code and you look-up your rule of origin and, you know, if it’s allowed in the rule of origin then you can use it. \r\n (Participant): Okay, so it specifically has to say that it’s allowed? \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, that’s right. \r\n (Participant): Okay. \r\n Anthony Hill: Sometimes it’s not allowed, that’s the thing. \r\n (Participant): Okay, so it must say if it’s allowed? I also had a really... \r\n Anthony Hill: Sometimes it’s an option, yeah. \r\n (Participant): Okay, and I had a quick question too about the most favored nation rate that was mentioned earlier. Where would I locate that? \r\n Anthony Hill: That would - well you can call the 1-800 number for the Trade Information Center - and they can help you with that. \r\n (Participant): All right. \r\n Anthony Hill: There’s also a way you can get to - you can look that up - online through export.gov. \r\n (Participant): Great. \r\n Roza Pace: And if I may also add Tony we did have a couple of very useful Webinars on that topic. One was on how to classify your products and another how to calculate your duties and taxes. \r\n When you try to register for our Webinars, we did add the link on the export.gov page to archived Webinars so at your convenience you can just go, click there and listen and see the Webinar, the recorded Webinar and if you have any questions about it, you could e-mail us. We could send you direct link. \r\n (Participant): Great. Thank you very much. \r\n Coordinator: And our last question comes from (Participant). Your line is open, sir. \r\n (Participant): Hi, Tony. This is (Participant) from Florida. Actually I have two comments regarding two calls that they had two questions, first one about Laredo and I believe they said they are filing the AES and if they are filing the AES that means they are the exporter of record. \r\n And if they are filing the AES on behalf of the importer, then they need to have an actual power of attorney from them to do so and that actually another question is for the lady that she’s doing the shipping. \r\n I believe she said that she had the receipt of purchase of the piano but she then she thought that would clear or basically qualify it for NAFTA but that doesn’t as everybody knows. It’s only receipt that we purchase it from here the piano could be made from, you know, in another country. \r\n However my question is I noticed that you only talked about preference criteria A, B and C but we didn’t talk about D, E and F. Is there a reason for that? \r\n Anthony Hill: Right, mainly because A, B and C are the most commonly used and this is a basic guide Webinar. We only have an hour, you know, and I did mention that I could talk to someone about the other preference criterion if they need to use those but they’re very specific. \r\n (Participant): Okay. \r\n Anthony Hill: It sounds like you would know. \r\n (Participant): No, actually I had the question about the D so... \r\n Anthony Hill: So D? \r\n (Participant): ...so I still have always, you know, questions about that. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, you could just send - why don’t you just - send me an e-mail? We can talk about it unless you want to ask your question now? \r\n (Participant): Actually the question is to cover the if you could in just briefly if you could talk about it and what makes it, you know, a product qualified for D? \r\n Anthony Hill: D? \r\n Roza Pace: You know, Tony, D. Tony I can read over to you the criterion. You probably don’t have on the screen. In a few cases a good that has not undergone the required tariff change can still qualify. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah. That is one actually... \r\n ((Crosstalk)) \r\n Anthony Hill: ...in very few circumstances where the parts and materials are - let’s say the parts and the final product - are categorized under the same HS code but the rule of origin says the HS code must change. \r\n So in that situation, the HS code could not have changed and so you could under that criterion still qualify. \r\n Roza Pace: And one more thought too that what I find useful when qualifying products for NAFTA - I’m sure Tony is doing the same - just across database, U.S. Customs has database of all kinds of Customs rulings. \r\n Now so for items that some companies already raised the questions to Customs to different ports, the cross-database which you can just Google C-R-O-S-S, Customs cross-database you can then search for whatever product or HS number category you’re looking at. \r\n And then already might be a ruling about whether preference Criterion D or whether you may have something about very esoteric situation or about trade value for automotive or just you could see whether something is there. \r\n You could also request a formal Customs ruling for your particular situation and but please be advised that those Customs rulings if you ship to Canada, the ruling will have to be made by the Canadian Customs. If it’s Mexico, it have to be Mexican Customs, not the U.S. Customs. \r\n Anthony Hill: Yeah, that’s a good point. \r\n (Participant): Well, that’s good to know. \r\n Anthony Hill: Right. Sometimes you have to resort to getting a Customs ruling. That’s an option of course. It takes more time but... \r\n (Participant): That is true. All right. Thank you so much, Tony. Thanks, everybody. That was very informative. Thanks. \r\n Roza Pace: Well, thank you everyone and as you know you have Tony’s contact information as well as our in Trade Information Center so please feel free to ask any questions and as we indicated, you will be getting a recorded Webinar. Thank you for dialing-in. \r\n Anthony Hill: Thank you very much, everyone. \r\n Dan Duvall: Thank you and sign-up for more Webinars. \r\n Coordinator: And thank you. Once again this does conclude today’s conference call.

Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to turn the meeting over to Roberta Ford. Ma’am you may begin. \r\n Roberta Ford: Thank you Operator. Hello and welcome to the global design and construction team’s informational Webinar on multilateral development banks. My name is Roberta Ford and I’m director of the U.S. Commercial Service Office in Columbus, Ohio. I’m also a member of the global design and construction team which is sponsoring this seminar. \r\n Today we are fortunate to have excellent speakers that have generously offered to share their knowledge and expertise. Today’s speakers are Mack Tadeu of the Inter-American Development Bank and David Fulton of the World Bank both located in Washington, DC. \r\n Also on the call today is the global design and construction team’s national team leader Terri Batch. As indicated in her email to all participants this morning, copies of today’s presentations will be emailed to all participants and you will also be given access to the archived recorded version of this Webinar online. \r\n Today’s Webinar will conclude with a generous Q\u0026amp;A period, so please jot down your questions or type them in the Q\u0026amp;A format in the toolbar at the top left hand side of your screen. If we don’t get to your question during the Webinar we will definitely provide you an answer via email. \r\n The U.S. Commercial Service is a trade promotion agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration. We have offices located in over 100 U.S. Cities and in over 70 countries worldwide. Our mission is to promote U.S. Commercial interests and assist companies selling U.S. products and services overseas. \r\n Some of the services that we provide are development of an international marketing strategy; obtaining international market research; identifying strategic partners to represent your products or services in international markets; one-on-one counseling on international markets and the opportunities they hold. Tell us your needs and we can also develop customized services and programs for you. The U.S. Commercial Service is here to assist you in every stage of the export process. \r\n Within the U.S. Commercial Service we are the global design and construction team, one of the group of industry-focused staff that serve and support the U.S. design and construction industry with its international business development. Please visit our team’s Website to find out more about events, opportunities, and market research geared especially for you. \r\n Multilateral development banks are institutions that provide financial support and professional advice for economic and social development activities in developing countries. \r\n The term multilateral development banks typically refers to the World Bank and four regional development banks, the Inter-American Development Bank, our Development Bank speaker today is from, and there are also three other regional banks -- the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development whose borrowing countries primarily consist of Eastern European countries. And they all have separate Websites which you can find more information. \r\n Now I’m going to introduce our first speaker, Mack Tadeu. Mack is currently the Director of Business Liaison to the U.S. Executive Director to the Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, DC. Prior to the IDB he served as the commercial counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Chile. \r\n He served from 1999 to 2002 as acting Regional Director for the East Asia Pacific Region of the U.S. Commercial Service in Washington, DC. As the Regional Director, he supervised the work of commercial officers and their staffs in 13 countries in that region. \r\n Mack served as Deputy Senior Commercial Officer for the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia, Brazil from 1995 to 1999. Prior to Brazil Mack was the Senior Commercial Officer in Panama for 2 years and Principal Commercial Officer for 2-1/2 years at the Consulate General in Guadalajara, Mexico. \r\n Mack earned a B.A. from Drew University in Madison, New Jersey and an M.A. in International Affairs from the School of International Service at the American University, Washington DC. Thank you Mack. \r\n Mack Tadeu: Thank you Roberta and also to Terri and your team for putting all this together and for my invitation to speak to you today. I will cover several things. For many of you who don’t - have not worked with the IDB in the past I would like to offer a brief background on the IDB, its mission, and development projects which might offer commercial opportunities for your firms. \r\n As the principal commercial liaison here at the IDB, I meet numerous countries - companies from across a myriad of sectors and industries who are looking to access the IDB programs and procurement opportunities that reach all of the 26 borrowing Latin American and Caribbean markets. \r\n My core objectives are to identify commercial opportunities for you, introduce you to the right professionals here in the IDB network both corporate in Washington, DC as well as in country, and to assure that you’re given a fair opportunity to pursue your business activities here with the bank. \r\n The IDB was founded about 50 years ago and is the largest source of multilateral lending to Latin America and the Caribbean. While the IDB shares many similarities with other credit institutions such as commercial banks -- for example when it approves a loan it expects to be repaid -- the IDB does operate to make a profit since its actions are accountable to the 47 country shareholders. \r\n But the core objective which is different than a regular commercial bank is not necessarily getting the highest return on capital but rather to promote economic and social development among its borrowing members. \r\n The IDB is composed of the IDB Bank, the Inter-American Investment Corporation, and the Multilateral Investment Fund. The IIC focuses on support for smaller and medium size businesses while the Multilateral Investment Fund promotes private sector growth through grants and other investments with an emphasis on microenterprise. Besides loans and grants it also provides technical assistance as well as research to guide its programming and consultation with the borrowing countries. \r\n In the Countries section of the IDB Website you can locate the country strategy report which outlines the principal themes between the IDB and the country in question. The U.S. government’s participation in the IDB is based on the principal that economic and social development of the region will offer greater security, stability, investment in prosperity, not only for the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean but also for the United States. \r\n Here you see a chart with the voting power of each member country at the bank. Its base - its shareholding power is based on the IDB’s ordinary capital. You’ll see that the U.S. is by far the largest shareholder with slightly more than 30% of voting power. The 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries that are borrowers have 50.2%, the theory being that ultimately the fate of the bank rests with its borrowers. \r\n The IDB has a AAA credit rating which allows it to borrow cheaply and lend at competitive rates. At the bank’s annual conference in April of this year the Board of Governors of the bank agreed in principle to increase the bank’s capital in order to double lending capacity also maintaining its excellent rating. So it’s looking to approve this year around $12 billion of loans. The $15.6 billion approved you see for last year was facilitated by an infusion of temporary capital in order to address the global financial crisis. \r\n In order to achieve a greater impact on development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the IDB has identified priority areas for its action and launched new initiatives aimed at emerging challenges facing the region. You see examples such as opportunities for the majority, sustainable energy and climate change initiative, water and sanitation initiative, and the education initiative. \r\n The IDB partners with countries to combat poverty and promote social equity through programs tailored to local conditions. Working with governments as well as with the private sector, the bank seeks to achieve sustainable economic growth, increase its competitiveness, modernize its public institutions, and foster free trade and regional integration. \r\n The bank’s programming is spread among a wide range of industries and development activities from investments in infrastructure projects such as roads and highways to less visible but credible projects that promote the modernization of government. One can find construction opportunities in most of these principal sectors. \r\n In the case of procurement opportunities, you can get started by visiting the bank’s Website that you see on your screen. The procurement page provides information on how to pursue business opportunities at the bank and its affiliates. You can sign up or what I call register for electronic alerts that provide timely information on the categories, countries, and sectors that you are most interested in. \r\n By clicking on a particular project you will get access to all of the relevant information that you need to submit your proposal. You will see detailed information on the project description giving you a full summary of the project, the intent of the project, where the project is within the project pipeline, is it in the design preparation, has it already been implemented or completed. \r\n Other basic information is what type of direct participation does the IDB have with the project. Is there a loan, a grant, some capacity building research. Also the value of the project, who is its partner in country so that you’ll see something called the executing agency or ministry which is usually the in country recipient of the loan or grant. \r\n And then you’ll see a slew of PDF files that offer other feasibility, engineering, and environmental studies that either need to be let out or have already been done for your review. \r\n Here is a picture of a snapshot of the construction opportunities there. When searching for projects on the IDB Website particularly regarding construction, you will need to search other related projects. These are just some of the probably I think it was 80 or 90 projects that came up when I looked under - searched under construction. \r\n Look under also infrastructure, architecture, engineering, energy, healthcare, etc. and the bank project will describe its construction needs or the procurement of environmental equipment, etc. as applicable. \r\n You can see the variety of projects here, where they are among the borrowing countries. I’m having trouble clicking here. I’m sorry, it jumped forward. This one on infrastructure gives you another view of what’s available. You can look under water and sanitation, road construction, agricultural reforestation, natural disaster and relief efforts among others. \r\n I wanted since many of my clients are looking at opportunities at Haiti and since the earthquake on January 12 the bank has upped its share of providing grants to Haiti. It has for many years been the leading source of long term financing in Haiti and it is looking now to look at about 40% of the financing and infrastructure projects, 20% in agriculture and environment, 25% in basic services, and 15% in governance and institutional capacity building to strengthen the Haitian public sector. \r\n In addition to the IDB shareholders to these grants I just mentioned, there are other such opportunities for research as well as environmental and other engineering studies that are needed. \r\n The IDB established the Haiti Response Group headed by (Augustina Guerra) here at the corporate headquarters and it works hand in hand with the Haiti Reconstruction and Development Agency in country to develop proposals for projects as per the assessment plan that was presented to the UN group in March. If you need more specific information outside of what the IDB is doing with Haiti you can find information on www.haiticonference.org. \r\n Here it shows you the construction opportunities. The IDB is looking to work in housing, transportation, water, education, disaster prevention in a big way, and then private sector and budget support. On the private sector side, restarting or expanding the competitive capabilities on the part of the Haiti export sector so they’re looking to partner with U.S. Companies. \r\n They’re also looking for cash for work programs as well as assistance in reforestation projects. They’re looking to foster economic development beyond the capital city. There are about nine such economic centers that they’re looking to establish and expand throughout the country as well as boost proposals and projects that are going to generate sustainable economic activity and job creation. \r\n Through the Multilateral Investment Fund and the Inter-American Investment Corporation the IDB is helping Haitian businesses get back on their feet by providing support through the financial system. The method is particularly active in assuring that microfinance institutions can continue making loans to their clients and distributing remittances especially in the countryside. \r\n So how do you make this all happen? To succeed in doing business with any member country at the IDB, I suggest the following building your strategic team. It’s imperative for you to work with the contacts you already have in region. \r\n In the case of construction, note that there are a myriad of very competitive local companies in country such as Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Columbia. \r\n They happen to be the five largest borrowing countries here with the IDB group, and given that the local borrowers are interested in local content and players particularly when it comes to construction, architectural engineering services, your strategy is to get to know those players in country and to offer to them value added through your specialty service or product or expertise which that local player might not have in its portfolio. \r\n You can partner with them or become a subcontractor once these bids have been won by these local companies in many cases and then offering your services at the subcontractor level. \r\n If you have worked in a Latin American or Caribbean country, start there, start in that country. Check the IDB Website, see what projects already being - are in process, are in the pipeline for you to participate in. Here is my contact information. I’ll be around for questions and answers after David’s presentation. Talk to you soon. \r\n Roberta Ford: Thank you Mack and all questions for Mack will be handled at the end of the Webinar which we should have plenty of time for questions. Next is David Fulton. He’s currently Advisor and Director of Business Liaison, Office of the U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank Group where he directs a program to assist U.S. Companies doing business with the World Bank and its clients. The World Bank lends billions of dollars to developing countries each year. \r\n Prior to the World Bank he served for two years as Director of Strategic Planning for the International Trade Administration in Washington, DC. David served as commercial counselor for the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy in Manila, the Philippines, from 2006 to 2008 and prior to the Philippines David was a commercial counselor for the U.S. Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy at Warsaw, Poland for three years. \r\n Mr. Fulton has a law degree from the College of William and Mary and a Masters Degree in Foreign Affairs from the University of Virginia. Thank you David. \r\n David Fulton: Thank you very much and good afternoon everyone. I’m delighted to be here. I’m going to follow Mack’s presentation with something slightly different focusing on the World Bank’s procurement and project cycle. This is going to be a very practical presentation and hopefully by the end you will have learned enough to be able to identify and track projects that might have biddable components not just in World Bank funded projects but in the other multilateral banks as well. \r\n I call this presentation Engaging With the MDBs because the multilateral development banks have more or less harmonized their project and procurement processes. The idea is that the borrowers, the client countries that seek funding from these banks, won’t have to learn dramatically different systems for borrowing the money. \r\n I call it PID, PAD, Procure because of all the documentation that you’ll find on the World Bank’s Website about projects and procurements and contracts, there’s really only three documents that you need to focus on from a business perspective. The PID is a concept paper, the Project Information Document it’s called, that sets out in five to seven pages the basic design and goal of any particular project. \r\n The Project Appraisal Document, the PAD, is a much longer document, anywhere from 100 to 200 pages long that sets out in great detail what the loan will be used for and what the goals and design of the project are. It includes a procurement plan for the first 18 months of the project so that after the loan has been approved by the World Bank’s Board of Directors the borrower, the host country government, will start to spend the money according to the procurement plan. \r\n So you’ll know quite far in advance in most cases what contracts are going to be signed by the host country government and this will enable you to focus on the opportunities that are most appropriate for your products or services. \r\n Procure in PID, PAD, Procure refers to the procurement notices that are published by the borrowers as they start to spend the money down. The rule of thumb to keep in mind is that if you borrow the bank’s money you have to spend it according to the bank’s rules and the bank’s procurement rules require public notification, public advertising for most kinds of contracts that you will be interested in. So by the end of this presentation if you remember nothing else you will remember PID, PAD, Procure. \r\n Now there’s four basic product lines at the multilaterals. I’m going to speak using the World Bank as the example because that’s where I happen to be assigned right now but this applies in large measure to the other MDBs as well. \r\n What we’ll spend most of the time on, all of the time today is on bank funded procurement where a foreign government is borrowing money from the World Bank to buy goods and services that it needs to implement a particular project. It might be a health project, a road project, a power project. The bank lends money, the foreign government spends it. \r\n There’s also corporate procurement which is a much smaller amount of money where the bank buys goods and services for its own account that probably amounts to maybe $800 million a year compared to last year’s lending which was over $70 billion in response to the economic crisis. There’s also trade finance products, carbon finance, and political risk insurance for investors. We’ll spend the time today speaking about the bank funded procurement because that’s where the bulk of the money is. \r\n This is what the project cycle looks like. It can be a very long project cycle. You have to have patience. I find that business development people appreciate the time they’ve got to develop the customer relationships they need. The folks that have a quarterly sales goal find this very frustrating because the projects can take quite a bit of time to develop. It’s a long sales cycle. \r\n It all starts with the country assistance strategy which is the bank’s five year plan for lending to a particular country. The bank’s staff will work with the borrower to identify the development gaps in that country. It might be lack of roads, a bad airport, a health system that needs work. \r\n Once that country assistance strategy has been put together and published then the bank’s staff will start identifying particular projects. And when I say project you should think lending project, what are they going to loan the money for. And it’s at that stage that you’ll see the first publicly available information about any particular loan, the project information document is published on the World Bank’s Website. That’s the PID. \r\n The bank staff then starts to prepare a very detailed description of the project, the PAD, that will be provided to the Board of Directors for approval. Once the Board of Directors has approved that project, that lending project, the project appraisal document with the procurement plan will be published. And at that point the borrower, the host country government starts spending the money. \r\n Now at each stage of this process you see these little red stars here. Those indicate points in the process where they may be procurement opportunities available that you can take a look at. \r\n Implementation gets the biggest star, because that’s where the bulk of the money is spent. In the early and late stages of the process the contracts tend to be small consulting engagements as the bank staff tries to develop the scope of the project and address any particular issues they might find. \r\n This is another way of looking at the project cycle. You have the same stages here on the left from concept to preparation to implementation and post evaluation. Implementation is in red because that’s where the bulk of the money is spent. \r\n In the second column you see the type of opportunity that’s typically available. In the early stages it’s going to be short term consulting, later stages it’s short term consulting, the implementation phase is where you find the larger contracts. \r\n The buyer or the customer is shown in the third column. Typically the World Bank is the customer for some of these smaller consulting contracts but the borrowing country is the customer during the implementation phase. This is where you want to concentrate your sales effort. \r\n Lots of different sources of information but from a business perspective the PID, the PAD, the procurement plan, the general procurement notice, and the specific procurement notice are the most important documents that you want to take a look at. \r\n Here is another way of looking at how the money flows and this also illustrates how you can get into this money flow as a vendor, as a supplier of equipment or services. The bank lends money to a foreign government which then uses and implementing agency, usually part of a government ministry, as the buyer. \r\n The buyer will spend the money for consultants, goods, and services and civil works that are needed to implement the project that they have agreed upon with the World Bank and all the contracts that will be spent are listed in the procurement plan. \r\n As a private company there’s three places you can get into this money flow. The first is as provider of technical assistance funded by the World Bank. These are those smaller consulting contracts that I mentioned earlier. In this case the bank is your customer and the government is the beneficiary of the work that you do. \r\n The second place is as a direct contractor to the implementing agency providing consulting, equipment, or civil works, the bricks and mortar. That’s where the bulk of the money is. It’s in the implementation phase. \r\n These contracts are put out for competition under the World Bank’s rules which have been harmonized with the other multilaterals as well so that the process is as transparent as possible and the World Bank staff looks over the shoulder of the borrower as that implementing agency is spending the money so that helps level the playing field. \r\n The third place you can get into the money flow is as a sub supplier to someone else who is in that direct contractual relationship, the prime contractor. The simplest example is if you manufacture bulldozers and there’s a road project funded by the World Bank, you’re not going to sell the bulldozers directly to the government ministry, you’ll sell them to the construction company that has won the contract to actually build the road. \r\n Now with that in mind, here are the key contacts that you need to address. And Mack foreshadowed this when he talked about the strategic team you need to build. The customers will be the government ministry or the prime contractor in most cases. The bank is not your customer. The bank is financing the project, the government ministry will spend the money under the World Bank’s procurement rules, or the prime contractor will select vendors and equipment providers by whatever system the contractor is using. \r\n U.S. Commercial Service and the Department of Commerce’s Advocacy Center and Mack and me and our colleagues at the other multilateral development banks, we’re also a part of your team as is the multilateral development bank’s task team leader. \r\n The task team leader is responsible for putting that project together with the ministry, shepherding it through the project appraisal process, getting it approved by the Board of Directors, then monitoring implementation and the progress of that project as the government spends through the money and implements the agreed upon project. \r\n So keep this in mind. The customer is going to be the government or the contractor who has won a contract from the government and these folks are part of the team, part of the process. \r\n Here is how the PID, PAD, procure pipeline looks. You start with the concept paper being released and after anywhere from three months to three years depending on the country and the complexity of the project the Board of Directors will vote. \r\n And 9 times out of 10 or should I say 99 times out of 100 if a concept paper is released the board will probably be approving the project because the bank staff doesn’t send forward projects that are going to be shot down at the board level. \r\n Once the board has approved it, that project appraisal document is released. It has the procurement plan in it so you’ll be able to see what kind of contracts are going to be coming available so that you might be able to bid on. Once the borrower has received the go-ahead to start spending they will publish a general procurement notice and then an explosion of specific procurement notices that will be used to advertise the particular contracts that are up for competition. \r\n And I have additional information available on how the competitive process works. We can talk at great length about the procurement process itself. And just as a general rule I find that the companies that are most successful at this sort of thing at the multilateral segment are companies that are already familiar with government procurement. So the system is not something that is alien to them and they’re able to follow the rules and to submit the bid on time and meet the requirements of the bid. \r\n And companies that have good international experience or can partner with another firm that has international experience. Those are the companies that are probably the most successful in at least the World Bank and probably the other banks as well in competing for those contracts. \r\n So to track these projects, what I find is that companies often go into the concept paper database which is on the World Bank Website and they will try to read all these project information documents to figure out where an opportunity might arise but there’s hundreds of them so how do you focus on the ones that are most likely for you. \r\n So what I found is that if you start at the other end and look at the procurement notices that have been published in the past then go backwards through the pipeline to the concept papers that produced those procurement opportunities, then you’re able to focus on the projects most likely to be of interest to you. \r\n So let me give you an example of that. Now I’ve drawn this one from the information technology arena simply because I think it’s probably the best example of this that I have found. \r\n This is a procurement notice that was published in March of 2009 with a deadline of April 29 and I brought this to the attention of a company that I thought would be able to pursue it and they were very excited because it was just what they were able to do, information technology, e-government services. But they were disappointed because they only had 30 days to prepare a proposal and you’re simply not going to prepare a competitive proposal for a contract in Vietnam with 30 days notice. \r\n So I pointed out to them that if they had been paying attention to the pipeline they would have seen the PAD, the project appraisal document, published two years earlier which specifically identified the contracts that were being put out for bidding. \r\n So when we’re looking at the procurement notice in terms of PID, PAD, Procure, we’re at the procure end of the pipeline. Now we see two years earlier the PAD was published very specifically identifying these e-government and ICT infrastructure contracts. \r\n And even better, if they had gone to the PID phase they would have had additional two years to engage with the customer, get to find a partner in Vietnam if they needed one, and they would have had a long time to work on this particular project to prepare for the contracts that would be signed by the ministry in this case. \r\n I will caveat this by saying Vietnam is a little bit slower than most of the countries. It doesn’t take four years in most cases for contracts to emerge from that PID, PAD, Procure pipeline. Sometimes yes, Vietnam happens to be a little slow. \r\n But using the information that we were able to gather they could go in and identify almost a dozen projects that would have potential biddable opportunities for them. So starting at the procurement end of the PID, PAD, Procure pipeline enables you to identify the projects going forward that may have opportunities for you. \r\n And here is where you find all these documents. The PIDs and the PADs are available on the World Bank’s Website and the other multilaterals also publish the concept papers and the detailed appraisal documents on their Websites. They’re fairly easy to find and now that you know these are the documents that are most important for you. \r\n In the case of the World Bank, the borrowers publish procurement notices in a local newspaper or a local Website and in a United Nations database called UN Development Business. Now this is a subscription database and if you’re interested I can talk to you a little bit more about that and we can schedule something separate. I can take you into the database and you can look to see if there are the type of opportunities that your company can provide. \r\n The other multilaterals, not the World Bank but the Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, etc., they publish the procurement notices on their own open Website. So in terms of PID, PAD, Procure the Inter-American Development Bank, Asian, African, European, you get the full pipeline right there on their Website. \r\n The World Bank is a little bit behind the times. They only publish the PIDs and the PADs. They have not yet begun to publish the procurement notices. You still have to get those from UN Development Business. \r\n But once you are in there and you look to see what kind of notices and most importantly how many are available that you could have pursued or might pursue in the future, you’ll get a good idea of whether this particular market segment is appropriate for your company and that’s a very important determination that you need to make. \r\n Is there a business opportunity and how big is that business opportunity, and then you can make the decision whether you’re going to devote the time and resources to pursuing that business opportunity. \r\n Now I’ll close here with this is just a sample of a procurement notice funded by the World Bank, a transport sector project in Tanzania. In this case they are going to be rehabilitating three airports in Tanzania and they’re looking for someone to carry out supervision of the implementation of works for the rehabilitation of that airport. \r\n The deadline for this was in July. I don’t think they’ve made an award yet but I use this just as an example. This is not a live one because the deadline is already passed. But as you can imagine, there will be other contract opportunities flowing from this particular project. \r\n You can take this project number, T055120, plug that into the World Bank’s Website, it will take you right to the PIDs and the PADs and you can learn all about that project. So I’m going to stop there and turn it back over to Roberta. \r\n Roberta Ford: Great, thank you David. (Rudy) at this time would you please instruct our attendees on the procedure for asking questions? \r\n Coordinator: Thank you. To ask a question please press star 1 and you must record your name. Once again, to ask a question press star 1 and record your name. One moment please. \r\n Roberta Ford: So the next steps for you is if - this free seminar has been brought to you as a series of Webinars that were offered by the U.S. Commercial Service to introduce our agency to new companies. If you were referred to us by one of our partners at UPS, FedEx, or the U.S. Postal Service, you will be contacted by your local trade specialist. \r\n If you joined us today via another source and have not worked with a local office yet, please visit our Website export.gov and click on Find a Local U.S. Office to locate your domestic office trade specialist by zip code. Our Website export.gov contains a wealth of information so we hope you will take some time to familiarize yourself with it. (Rudy) do we have any questions? \r\n Coordinator: There are no questions at this time. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay Terri, do we have any typed in questions? \r\n Terri Batch: There are none at this time. \r\n Roberta Ford: None, okay. All right I have a question David and Mack. Do the banks require developing countries to privatize their industries and assets in order to receive funding? \r\n Mack Tadeu: On the part of the IDB, no. Again in terms of most of the lending from the IDB it is public sector lending, so it goes to individual country ministries or public agencies or institutions. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay thanks Mack, anything to add David? \r\n David Fulton: On the World Bank side the answer is roughly the same. The bank doesn’t require them to privatize industries or for example utilities or state owned companies but they encourage it because they believe that the private sector runs these things a lot more efficiently than the government does. \r\n And so in order to assist in that process they offer not just loans and financing for projects related to those particular companies, but there is a part of the bank called the International Finance Corporation which offers business advisory services and they will assist in the privatization of those companies. But as far as requiring it, no they don’t. \r\n Mack Tadeu: And the International Finance Corporation, IFCN, the World Bank, the IDB equivalent is the Multilateral Investment Fund, pretty much the same modus of operandi. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay thank you. (Rudy) any questions yet? \r\n Coordinator: Yes, one moment please. (Jay Procosh Ukala), your line is open. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It’s been a very educational Webinar today but I have a couple of questions. I have some contacts in West African countries like Nigeria and also (Santa Lofical) Republic and Ivory Coast. They have major projects like infrastructure, local housing, etc. and I have some connections here in the U.S. for solar energy for either the residential or commercial projects. \r\n How would we - and one of the government I know the country I’m going to mention has a very bad reputation but it’s Nigeria. And through one of my partners in Nigeria he’s dealing with the governor of one of the states and they are looking for financing for some of this infrastructure and housing projects for that state. And they are also willing to offer sovereign guarantee. \r\n Now pardon my knowledge but I’m not familiar what sovereign guarantee means. How would that help in getting loans from say World Bank, INF, or in fact maybe even OPEC? Also private investment corporation may be able to get involved in this project. How do I go about this? \r\n David Fulton: Well first of all there’s two possibilities, the World Bank and/or the African Development Bank and then you have to divide the customer into two categories. One is the government customer and the other is the private sector customer. If the customer for that particular project is the government of Nigeria then the government of Nigeria probably through the Ministry of Finance approaches the World Bank or the African Development Bank and asks to - for a loan for a particular project. \r\n If the customer is a private sector entity, a private company, then that customer can approach the IFC which is part of the World Bank or the equivalent in the African Development Bank, I don’t recall the name off the top of my head. But the IFC would look at the project as a possible equity investment or a loan just as any other private bank. \r\n You have to remember that the World Bank, the African Development Bank, they are banks. There is a certain amount of money that’s available for grants but for the most part they are lending or investing and they expect to earn a return on their funds. \r\n The mistake many companies make in dealing with governments in the developing countries I think is when the government tells that company go to the World Bank and see if you can get a loan for me. The World Bank will not talk to you. The World Bank will talk to their customer which is the government of Nigeria. \r\n So when you’re talking to government officials in any country and they tell you they can get a sovereign guarantee for a particular project, they’re referring to a sovereign guarantee for a private loan from Citi or J.P. Morgan, whoever, that you might be able to arrange. And so you have to be able to distinguish among the different types of loans and investments that are available. \r\n But for the most part keep in mind that the government is going to have to go to the World Bank if they are seeking money for an infrastructure project, not you. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): Right, okay. And so when the World Bank - after the country has gone through the PID and PAD and procurement and all that sort of stuff, and when the government is ready to loan the money to that country for a specific project, do they expect any kind of collateral from the country or not? \r\n David Fulton: No, the bank lends the money to the government, the government then spends the money. The bank does not require collateral for its loans to sovereign governments. They sign a loan agreement in which the government agrees to repay the loan over 20 or 30 years at a particular interest rate. \r\n If the government defaults on the loan that is a very bad thing for their ability to borrow money on the open capital markets and so governments tend not to default on their multilateral development bank loans although of course it has happened in the past. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): Okay. \r\n Mack Tadeu: Keep in mind that oftentimes the multilateral development banks are the ones that come in and what are projects or countries that are deemed to - or be perceived at high risk which in many cases the private sector banks are unwilling to lend because of the level of risk. \r\n So that you’re looking at the multilateral development banks coming in and providing those loans and securing those loans in many areas which oftentimes will open up other commercial lines knowing that the multilateral development banks are part of the project. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): Okay. If I may just ask one more question, time permits? \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay go ahead, we have ten minutes. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): We all know about some corruption and things like that in different countries especially in the African countries where at the government level there are problems. How do we get over that? How do we make sure that - well I know it’s not your money or my money but it’s the government’s money. How is that protected as far as the corruption and things like that are concerned? And if we do find something, what do we do about that? \r\n David Fulton: The World Bank’s project appraisal document for any particular loan will include a section in which they assess the ability of the borrower to implement the procurement and that directly addresses the possibility for fraud and corruption. The ability to implement a project and to do the procurement properly is not just a question of will the money be lost to corruption. It’s also can that particular implementation agency select the right equipment. \r\n If the agency for example in a construction project has been involved in the building of playgrounds and driveways and has never done the work required for a multilane highway, then they will need assistance so that they don’t do the wrong thing and the bank will provide that assistance to them. \r\n In terms of what can you do when you uncover or you come across evidence of corruption, often a good place to start is going to be with the U.S. Embassy in that country because not wiping out corruption but assisting governments in the fight against corruption is something that the U.S. government is very involved in. \r\n The multilateral development banks also have very robust anti-corruption programs but they tend to be not particularly helpful when it comes to specific corruption issues on particular cases. So I would say start with the U.S. Embassy. \r\n Roberta Ford: And your local trade specialist can give you the contact information for our embassy in Lagos. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): I have that. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay great. Thank you. \r\n Mack Tadeu: Keep in mind also with the World Bank, David obviously covers the entire globe and again, when you’re looking at a country look at the regional development bank, what it’s doing there as well as the World Bank so you have two parts of this portfolio that you should look at in any country market. \r\n David Fulton: Yes and the banks work together. They try not to step on each other’s toes so if you look at the World Bank and they don’t seem to be active in a particular sector in a particular country, then look at the Inter-American Development Bank. Maybe that’s the bank that’s funding work in that particular sector. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): Okay great, beautiful. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay thank you. \r\n (Jay Procosh Ukala): Thank you so much. \r\n Roberta Ford: Terri would you read a typed in question please? \r\n Terri Batch: Yes we have two questions, one comes from (Brent Ritzel). He says that they are a renewable energy company that designs and builds sustainable power plants and manufacturing facilities. They have a large scale project for Haiti at about $409 billion with financing but they are in need of a loan guarantee. Who has loan guarantee programs for such a product, especially one that is located in Haiti? \r\n Mack Tadeu: In this case it would be the Inter-American Development Bank for this reason. At the New York City conference, the UN conference in March, there were the principal donors as far as the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, and then the governments of the U.S. primarily U.S., France, and Canada who pledged the bulk of trust funds that the World Bank will be holding for the reconstruction of Haiti. \r\n Now there was a separate agency set up in Haiti called the HIRC which is the reconstruction executive agency co-led by former president Clinton as well as the Prime Minister of Haiti. \r\n All projects are being approved through this central unit for the main purpose of looking at what monies are available, which ones the government can guarantee or certainly work with the foreign lenders to guarantee, and make sure that across the spectrum of activity that needs to happen in Haiti in rebuilding the country that there’s a good amount of activity in each of the principal areas of development like the ones I mentioned in a couple of slides that I offered to you. \r\n So check with your local contact. Check here with the IDB. Give me a call later on or an email and let me know specifically what project this is and see if the IDB is working on that project. In several instances there may be other donors who are doing it directly and so you’d have to probably work with that donor government for the guarantee. \r\n Terri Batch: Okay we have one more question that was typed in. This question is from (Bruce Anderson) and he asks if the World Bank loans to governments. Does the IDB finance private projects? Can you answer that Mack as well? \r\n Mack Tadeu: Okay as far as the World Bank will provide loans not only to the government but also to the private sector through the IFC and the IDB does the same thing. Both principally public sector lending but then private projects either through the multilateral investment fund or more on the micro trade capacity building side with the Inter-American Investment Corporation which is part of that bank group. \r\n Roberta Ford: Great. (Rudy) do we have any more called in questions? \r\n Coordinator: Yes, one moment please. T-Bone Industries, your line is open. \r\n Ray Aldrich: Thank you. Are you - am I coming through? \r\n Roberta Ford: Yes sir, go ahead. \r\n Ray Aldrich: Okay. This is Ray Aldrich with T-Bone Industries. The question I had was like the project in Chile, our plans are to go down, we have a multitude of green technologies that involves everything from airports and roadways and bridges to houses, prophylactic centers, green factories, and hospitals. \r\n Our new green geospatial building technology is second to none in the world. We need funding to put this together so we can be ready for the tour coming up on October 12 I think it is in Chile. \r\n And what our plan is to go down there, introduce the technology to them, talk to them, take our engineers with us, and let them see what we have to offer. Then if we go down there and do that not only will we help them begin to get over the hump of rebuilding but our new technologies will allow them to build somewhat earthquake proof buildings. \r\n Roberta Ford: And so your question is how do you accomplish this by October 12? \r\n Ray Aldrich: Yeah. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay. Gentlemen do you want to handle this or should I? \r\n Mack Tadeu: Well what I know of, are you referring sir to the trade or show exhibition that the commercial section in Santiago is working? \r\n Ray Aldrich: Yes. \r\n Mack Tadeu: Okay so you’re - have you already registered as an exhibitor? \r\n Ray Aldrich: I believe I did, yes. \r\n Mack Tadeu: Okay well I would say work primarily with (Mitch Larson) who is David’s and my counterpart at the U.S. Embassy there. He has someone on staff who is spearheading all of that and the show organizer happens to be (Culman) International. What I do know too is the importance with a country like Chile, I served there for 4 years, 4-1/2 years, there are a lot of local companies with the expertise you’re talking about. \r\n Keep in mind that again at the other end of the continuum as far as what happened with the earthquake in Chile as opposed to the one in Haiti, the one in Chile being that much more powerful with less than 700, less than 1000 people being killed and then you have a less powerful one in Haiti where over 200,000 people were killed. \r\n You look at there are - they have one of the most stringent earthquake proof building codes in the world. It rivals western United States and Japan as far as that is concerned. So what they’re going to be looking for is what other type of information you might be providing or service. \r\n The key here is finding a local partner. Construction firms are quite strong in Chile so most of the money is actually the government of Chile is not asking for outside lenders. They’re handling it themselves in country so they do have an active private banking sector as well as the government has trust funds available for the reconstruction. So most of your contacts will be in country. The IDB is doing very little in this regard. \r\n Ray Aldrich: Also what we’re going to do is not only help them rebuild but to actually build the factories down there to where they can have their own territory to - these are composite type building systems. \r\n Roberta Ford: Right so you can work with our office there in Santiago, or they can help you partner with local firms in order to accomplish that. \r\n Ray Aldrich: Okay. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay. \r\n Mack Tadeu: That show there is a great start in October. \r\n Roberta Ford: And your local trade specialist can get you access to the commercial officer there or any other countries where we have offices. Thank you. \r\n Ray Aldrich: Thank you. \r\n Roberta Ford: Operator do we have any more called in questions? \r\n Coordinator: There are no more questions at this time. \r\n Roberta Ford: Okay great, we are right at an hour so we’ll call this conclusion to our Webinar and thank you all for joining us. Goodbye. \r\n David Fulton: Good day. \r\n Mack Tadeu: Thank you, goodbye. \r\n Coordinator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference call.

Now I would like to introduce, live online Senior Commercial Counselor James Fluker. James, thank you for joining us. \r\n James Fluker: Thank you very much Linda and welcome to all of you who are joining us today for this presentation. I hope you’ll find it useful and as you see, the title is “Market Opportunities in Turkey”, and from our perspective and certainly from the level of interest we’ve been getting from U.S. Companies, which is really increased over the last year, there really are opportunities here despite the downturn. \r\n And we’d like to tell you a little about where those lie and how we can help you take advantage of them. \r\n As Linda also mentioned I’m here with Gregory Taevs, our Principal Commercial Officer in Istanbul and he’ll be speaking a little later. \r\n To start out with you see, for those of you who are on Webinar presentation, the PowerPoint, you see a map of Turkey and its immediate location. Turks are very fond of saying they’re in a bad neighborhood and if you take a look at their neighbors you can see that it is indeed a pretty tough neighbor. \r\n Going around clockwise from the Black Sea, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Syria and then on over to Europe where they have Greece and Bulgaria. \r\n The flip side or the advantage of being in this neighborhood is that the Turks have become experts at dealing with their neighbors. And either as representatives for U.S. Companies in this region or as partners, or contractors. They are real pros at going into these markets and beyond into the rest of the Middle East into Central Asia and the former Soviet Union and being successful there. \r\n For Turkey itself, you can try to imagine the country split north to south down the middle. Traditionally Western Turkey has been the power and in fact they still, Western and Eastern Turkey, they still retain very different identities. Eastern Turkey tends to be more Middle Eastern, more like a developing country. The demographics on average are very different. Incomes are lower, families are larger, and life expectancy is lower, much more similar to some of their neighboring countries. \r\n Western Turkey has traditionally had a much higher per capita income and it’s traditionally been where foreign companies came to do business. The interesting thing is that over time, especially over the last five or ten years, there’s been a gradual movement of prosperity and development further eastward. \r\n So while a company traveling to Turkey today still might just go to the main cities of Turkey about which I’ll talk a little more. But increasingly companies will want to go to sort of the second tier cities of Turkey, further in Central Turkey and further to the east. Several of these are the so called Anatolian tigers. Cities like Gaziantep, in the South Central, Trabzon also, Cazare have all developed economies and have much more disposable income and have grown in population significantly. \r\n Let’s talk a little about Turkey’s key cities; again these are the traditional key cities and probably the cities that any business coming to Turkey for the first time would want to visit. Istanbul, of course, I put down a population of 13 million. If you talk to Turks they’ll tell you that probably the population, due to the immigration that’s come in over the last several years, is closer to 15 million or even more than that. Istanbul is known to most business people and certainly tourist and maybe many individuals only stop in Turkey. \r\n It’s as I say the business financial and cultural center. As you can see they handle the lion’s share of the business for the entire country of Turkey. And they have the lion’s share of both industrial production and of representatives, distributors, importers. \r\n However Ankara the national capital has become increasingly important since it was established as the Capital in the 1920s. It’s gone from a very sleepy provincial town to what you see here on the slide in front of you with a population of 4.5 million. \r\n It’s still very much sort of like Washington D.C. to Istanbul’s New York, it tends to be very government centric. However many sectors, business sectors established themselves here because of the heavy government involvement in those sectors such as Defense, Energy, Agriculture, and Agra business. I’d add to that also the Health Sector for example \r\n Finally Izmir, which used to be called Smyrna, before Turkish independence. The third largest city with the country’s second largest port is also extremely important and a major industrial and trading center. \r\n I’ll slip back to the map just to indicate, you can see those are all in the eastern half with Ankara the closest to the center. As I say there’s movement taking place but for the moment a company coming to Turkey, for the most part, would probably look to those three cities first. \r\n Here are a few facts about Turkey, population 74 million and growing steadily. Median age of just under 28, it’s a very, very young population. Increasingly educated, increasingly interested in the comforts of life and new technologies in communications technologies, in telephones, and in all sorts of - whatever you would expect younger people in European countries to be interested in. \r\n Politically, Turkey is a parliamentary democracy and I think it’s very important to point out that it’s a true Democracy and anyone who’s been here to hear the sometimes very passionate debates between various sides within Turkey will know immediately that it really has the vibrancy and open debate of a democratic country. \r\n On the international relations side, Turkey is a charter member of NATO. Turkey became a NATO member in the early years of the cold war when Turkey was viewed as a front line state in the containment of the Soviet Union. \r\n But now it’s equally important as a partner of the U.S. and of the United Nations in Afghanistan of the U.S. in Iraq and elsewhere. Turkey has been a very good partner of the U.S. \r\n And finally with its eye on becoming a full member of the European Union, Turkey has been a member of the EU Customs Union since 1996 which has implications for countries doing business in Europe who are looking at Turkey as a possible additional market or basing themselves in Turkey and looking to export or do business in Europe. And we’ll talk a little more about that later. \r\n Getting to the economic side here are some numbers. As you can per capita income compares favorably with the new EU Accession Countries especially in the Southeast. And as I mentioned earlier, that means that in the west of Turkey that per capita income is much higher, disposable income is much higher and urban concentrations of people are much higher too. \r\n GDP growth rate slowed after real impressive growth for most of this decade to 1.5% last year. Which for those of you looking at world growth figures and growth figures of other countries, is still pretty good. \r\n They have finally come around to admitting we’ll probably see shrinkage. We’ll probably see negative growth for this year. Some people and analysts are suggesting negative 3.4%. Others have suggested more but I think Turkey is in a position to be somewhat cushioned from that GDP shrinkage and will perform pretty well compared to many other countries. \r\n Inflation at the end of 2008 was 10.2% which may sound a little high to some observers. We expect it to go lower this year, but for those of you who may have visited Turkey 10 years ago or even 5 years ago you’ll know that this is a phenomenal improvement. \r\n When I first arrived in Turkey, in Istanbul back in 1997 inflation had just exceeded 100% and it stayed up in mid to high double digits for the entire 4 years I was here. This is an impressive number and one that they’ve been able to maintain for several years now. Low inflation is very important and is a result of many Turkish government economic reforms. \r\n Unemployment is right now up at over 15% which is quite high. Some say 20% in the cities. Again, that puts them at the high end for unemployment but again that’s a number that we feel Turkey will be able to deal with. \r\n All of these numbers and a few other facts suggest to us that Turkey is really well positioned to ride out the economic storm that the world is going through now. I’d point out a couple of additional facts. First of all the banking sector is probably the envy of most European countries. \r\n Banks here went through crises in 2001 that is strangely similar to the financial crises that banks in the rest of the world have been going through in the last year. But what it meant was that the Turkish banking sector had its shake down cruise 8-7 years ago and is now is very good shape has stayed out of many of those financial instruments that have endangered Western, European, Asian, and U.S. banks. \r\n Secondly, the political situation here is extremely stable. The government has been run for most of this decade by a single party. The AK Party without a coalition. They have received enough votes to run it on their own. And again, for those of us who remember old Turkey with coalition governments similar to Italy needed - went through constant changes and internal conflicts. \r\n This stability has meant that economic reforms have been put through and stuck to for many years here. And those reforms are another important factor. They’ve stemmed, I think, mainly from Turkey’s hope of eventual full EU membership. But many people here acknowledge that those reforms and continued process of EU Accession is important to Turkey whether or not it ever becomes a full member of the European Union. \r\n Those factors have meant the growth of business across the board. Economic growth as I mentioned before has been 5% to 8% on average for most of this decade and one of the things that’s helped that growth has been the sudden increase, sharp increase in foreign direct investment. \r\n Turkey before from the early part of this decade and the 30 years before a good year in foreign direct investment meant maybe $1 billion coming in. And then with the reform package that was introduced, foreign investors suddenly found this a much more attractive place to come into. \r\n And as you can see from the graph there the years 2006, ‘07, and ‘08 any one of those far exceeded previous years foreign direct investment and together they represent more investment flowing into Turkey than the previous 30 years combined. \r\n A little about Turkey’s trade picture - Turkey’s major trading partner is Russia. And that’s largely due to Russia being the main supplier of energy of gas and oil to Turkey. Turkey imports, I think, over 90% of its energy needs and Russia is the chief beneficiary of that about 65% of Turkey’s gas comes from Russia. \r\n And then you see a lot of EU Countries on that list too. If you put all the EU together as the slide indicates they’d account for 40% of total Turkish trade. The U.S. has while trade has grown as you’ll see in later slides, as a share total share of total imports and exports the U.S.A. has fallen a few slots. And as of 2008 was in 5th place overall. \r\n In 2008 the U.S. had its best year ever with regard to exports to Turkey. That grew from six point-something billion dollars the previous year. So about 60% plus they grew between 2007 and 2008 to $10.4 billion. \r\n Imports from Turkey have been pretty stagnant at between 4 and $5 billion or so. However, on the exports to Turkey from the U.S. we’ll see as you can imagine a drop in total exports this year. We’ve already seen a sharp drop to numbers similar to previous years. \r\n But I expect to see these numbers recover after 2009. As a matter of fact when President Obama made his recent visit to Turkey and met with President (unintelligible) and the Prime Minister they all agreed that the commercial relationship between the two countries was not at all in sync with the strategic relationship nor with the size and importance of the two economies. \r\n So we’re looking at ways to try to build the commercial relationship as the commercial service we’re especially interested in, of course, U.S. exports to Turkey and also in Turkish investment into the U.S. But we’ll be examining ways to work with the Turkish and with the Turkish private sector to bring companies from the two countries together to do business and we’ll tell you a little about one of the initiatives coming up at the end of this presentation. \r\n Just a quick rundown, I won’t go point-by-point, through currently these are the top U.S. exports to Turkey. Scrap steel and ore are at the top of the list along with civilian aircraft. Turkey’s the second biggest importer of raw cotton after China, because, of course, because of their huge garment and textile industry. \r\n It’s interesting to note there are some things that don’t show up because this is a merchandise list but for instance Turkey is the biggest user in Europe of U.S. higher education. They have 12,000 students studying at U.S. Colleges and Universities in the U.S. in any given year. \r\n And I think that’s hugely important not only in terms of the income that generates for the U.S. and for U.S. Universities but also it means a rapidly growing group of Turks who are familiar with the U.S., comfortable doing business with the U.S., speak English of course and they’ll be sort of at the vanguard increasing our commercial relations. \r\n Outside of the areas on this list the sectors I’d also point out a few others; medical, the medical sector is important, software business, and personal and gaming software is of interest to the Turks, agra business and food processing also is becoming increasingly important. \r\n There’s going to be a back log of major projects that are going to need to be re-initiated or brought back online. We think they’ll be real interest in green building products and in related design and engineering and of course in power generation and environmental technologies. \r\n Again, a list of Turkish exports to the U.S. A lot of that scrap iron and steel as you can see comes back to the U.S. in the form of semi-finished iron and steel products; Iron and steel fittings, and tubes and rod. You can also see that from some of these major sectors that they’d be badly affected by the U.S. housing and general construction downturn. For instance Turkey is the largest supplier of stone, marble, and other masonry, construction related masonry. And to the tune of I think about half a billion dollars the year before last but this has fallen very sharply. Again, as the world economy recovers we expect to see those exports to the U.S. recover too. \r\n A little about various aspects of doing business in Turkey - Companies that are already doing business with the European Union will find that Turkey has been initiating many of the EU directives. \r\n They will not be subject to duties when moving products into Turkey that have already entered the EU and other countries. So this implementation of EU directives on the road to full EU Accession means that Turkey for commercial purposes is not quite completely, there are some differences, but in very many ways a natural partner for businesses based in the EU. \r\n For instance the Turks require the CE mark on the items that Europe requires the CE mark also. If you’ve already got your CE mark and you’re exporting to the EU it makes exporting to Turkey much easier. \r\n I’ve mentioned the strategic location for regional markets and also the value of Turkish partners in terms of their understanding of doing business in the surrounding regions. And also of their willingness to take risks to go into those markets. \r\n Extremely active in Iraq, they’re willing to take chances and go into those markets where companies from other countries might not necessarily do so. \r\n I talked a little about the educated work force and young population. Turkey also is working hard on making this a more attractive environment particularly for investors but for any company looking to do business here. \r\n Not just in terms of ownership but in terms of the legal environment. Companies still tell us that bureaucracy is oppressive and that the legal system is not 100% predictable or reliable, decisions can take a long time. But nevertheless we see Turkey moving its legal system in the direction of becoming modernized and more effective. \r\n If you’re interested in doing business in Turkey many of the points on this slide will not come as surprises to you. They’re shared with any market you’ll go into. But certain factors in Turkey make it important for you to know your risks and know your partners as well as you can. \r\n Information on Turkish buyers and other perspective partners is not necessarily as easily available as it is in Western Europe or in the U.S. But there are various avenues to do your research on your market and your due diligence. \r\n I just mentioned that the commercial service, in fact, offers fee-based services to perform research for you and also due diligence project called International Company Profile if you’re interested in investing in the background of a buyer or prospective partner. \r\n Know and mitigate to the extent possible the risks here. I would link this to the last point on the slide about identifying financing options. The U.S. export, import bank is extremely active in Turkey. It’s one of their top markets for exposure. They’re always looking for new business here they’re open for all kinds of products as is the U.S. governments Oversees Private Investment Corporation which will insure investments here that have U.S. equity in them. \r\n You would want to look to both those organizations and perhaps other U.S. government agencies when looking for ways to mitigate risks. As well as looking to private banks that either work with XM bank or will provide coverage of some kind on their own. \r\n Using due diligence and our research products and those of private companies that also offer them you can also identify experienced professional assistance. All the major accounting firms are here. Several U.S. banks are here. \r\n You can, if you’re already doing business with them in the U.S. you can find them here too to assist you for your financial requirements. Human Resources firms are here. There’s a real large selection of business service companies that you can come to for assistance. \r\n Just a general point if you’re coming here and if you’re going to a little further down the line be translating your marketing materials, manuals, other things it’s a one-time cost so it pays to find the best translators that you can to do that for you. Again, when you come to that point we can give you some contacts for that. \r\n The same goes for interpreters. When you come here to do meetings, find the best. Ideally find specialists and be willing to pay that one-time cost while you’re working to establish the initial relationship. \r\n Once you’ve done that expect to spend time building your relationships. Again, this isn’t too different from all around the Mediterranean, Southern Europe and into the Middle East. Their relationship based and they will move slowly as they build a relationship with you either as a buyer or as another kind of partner. \r\n One of the ways that we’re trying to assist U.S. Companies to find out about the Turkish market and to enter it is an upcoming trade mission that is sponsored by Federal Express. And we’re working together with Federal Express to bring in trade delegation November 8 to 13 and at this point I’d like to ask Greg Taevs to say a few words about our plans for the mission. \r\n Gregory Taevs: Okay, Jim. I think Jim did a great job of laying out the potential, the possibilities of the Turkish market. I think a great way to get a fast start in a market is by taking advantage of one of these trade missions. I will say that in my years of working with the Commercial Service. They don’t come along very often so if you have one on the horizon it’s good to focus on it. \r\n This one is particularly focused on Turkey. It’s a one week program in Turkey. You’ll arrive on Sunday, November 8 in Istanbul. You’ll spend the first three days in Istanbul. Istanbul’s the cultural, the commercial capital of Turkey and the largest city. You’ll have one-on-one appointment very targeted appointment, with possible partners according to your needs. You’ll meet officials of local business organizations and next you’ll spend a day in Ankara. \r\n You’ll go from Istanbul to Ankara which is the real capital of Turkey. The central government here has a greater role in business than it does in the United States. \r\n It’s good to meet the government officials that affect the business in your sector. And then you’ll finish the mission with a day in Izmir which is the second largest port in Turkey. A lot of ocean-going traffic comes into Turkey and in and out of Turkey through Izmir. There’s also a large free trade zone there which you’ll be able to explore. \r\n And the goals of this mission of course are to learn about the market, to evaluate the potential for your company. You’ll meet your customers, you’ll meet possible partners, you’ll understand who your competitors are in the market, you’ll understand the opportunities. \r\n We have an excellent team of trade specialists in our offices that will work with you closely to find the right partners and the right meetings for you. You’ll have some key contacts when you leave Turkey from this mission. You’ll have some key contacts both in the government and your industry sector. \r\n I’ll just mention that even though we’re working closely with Fed Ex you wouldn’t have to be an existing customer of Fed Ex to join the mission. And well anyway I highly recommend joining the mission. \r\n I think I’ll end it there and if Jim would like to say anything else, and if not I’ll turn it over to Linda. \r\n James Fluker: Sure, Greg I’d just point out we’ve got up on the slide the URL on the Fed Ex Web site that gives more information about the trade mission and also will let you register your interest in the Trade Mission. \r\n Also our commercial service contact for the mission is (Greg Briscoe). (Greg) is based in Memphis and he’ll be happy to assist you and if you have more questions you can come to him or of course you could come to any of us and we’ll make sure that you get a response. \r\n Here’s contact information for the three commercial officers who are based in Turkey. Myself, (Thomas Bruns,) the Commercial Officer here in Ankara who unfortunately couldn’t be with us, and Greg Taevs in Istanbul. \r\n Thanks very much for your attendance today and we’ll open ourselves to questions if you have any, Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, great, thank you James and thank you Greg. Now we’re able to take the questions from our audience. Once again up on the upper left hand corner or upper left hand side of your computer is an icon and it has the letters Q\u0026amp;A. If you go to that icon you can actually type in a question in that space that’s provided underneath. \r\n Also I just want to remind everybody to please note the contact information on your screen of our speakers this is the best way to communicate and talk with them after our Webinar. \r\n Also this is a reminder, I would like to let you know that also we will have this recorded, this Webinar on our Web site at www.export.gov under the link called View Webinars. It’s on the right hand side of the export.gov Web page. That’s www.export.gov, that e-x-p-o-r-t.gov for government - gov on the right hand side there is a link, it’s in the gray area and it’s called V-i-e-w and then Webinar. \r\n When you click on that link you will be presented to a page that will explain a little bit about Webinars and also it will show the archive Webinar library or the archive Webinars that we have currently done and this will be included in that library. \r\n I do have a question. It looks like this question is from (Scott Altman). I’ll present the first question. The question is can you say anything about the FCPA, Foreign Corrupt Practice Act environment. \r\n James Fluker: Thanks for the question (Scott). I’ve been in several countries since I joined the commercial service. I’ve been in countries that had a very crippling environment of corruption. Turkey is not one of them. \r\n Corruption exists; we like to find out about it when we can, when companies do confront it. It’s a natural outgrowth, I think, of a bureaucracy. Turkey has its issues but I will say that many, many U.S. Companies operate and prosper here without having to confront or deal with demands from local businesses or buyers or partners. As I say we’re very conscious of it but you can operate in this country without running a fowl of the FCPA. \r\n Greg, do you have anything to add to that? \r\n Gregory Taevs: No I’d say that there are some big established U.S. Companies here and they do just fine, you know, avoiding any sort of problems with the FCPA. \r\n James Fluker: Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Once again thank you Jim and Greg for your response. I’ll go to the next question. The next question is from (Hedra) (unintelligible) the question is what is the tax structure in Turkey? \r\n James Fluker: Well, I think that (Hedra) I’ll have to come back to you with more details. The tax structure can be complicated. It is somewhat aggravated by the fact that there’s huge unofficial economy here especially when it comes to social security and other taxes. \r\n Legitimate investors legally established companies find themselves paying these taxes in essence supporting companies that don’t pay these taxes and their workers. \r\n But overall I would say the tax burden is not onerous, although we would like to see improvements. We also have a bilateral treaty with the Turks on withholding, but again, we think there are ways that could be improved. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay, thanks Jim. Next question I have here is from (Charles Hamilton). The question is does Turkey have plans to invest in infrastructure as a way of stimulating their economy like the U.S.? \r\n James Fluker: Turkey has developed a stimulus plan in response to the economic situation. They have been focusing for some time, and even more so now, on the Southeast of the country. \r\n Which has been chronically underserved by infrastructure and they are planning to invest even more money in the Southeast now. Outside of that there has been and continues to be investment in roads, in railways, in airports, and ports and also in the communications infrastructure. \r\n The most heavily regulated sectors are probably in the broadcasting area, of course defense industries, and in I would say also in agriculture right now. Traditional agriculture is very heavily burdened with Turkish policies that make it difficult to do business on a large scale level. Greg. \r\n Gregory Taevs: I guess the medical sector is one that’s pretty heavily regulated according to the pharmaceutical companies but they are able to cope with it and it’s actually one of their bigger markets. \r\n James Fluker: That’s a good point. Intellectual property concerns continue in Turkey. I’d want to add that Turkey was put on the U.S. Government Special 301 Watch List for intellectual property protection. Meaning they found it pretty lacking. And we’re urging the Turks to continue to make advances in implementing and enforcing intellectual property protection laws especially with regard to the pharmaceutical sector and to some extent of course with software and recorded media. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Great, thank you Greg and thank you Jim. I believe that’s all the questions I currently have. \r\n I would just like to remind everybody to please note the contact information on your screens to get in contact with the speakers. Also, please check out the foreign commercial services Web site on Turkey at www.buyusa.gov/turkey/en for the English version. Also please check out the Youth Commercial Services Web site at www.export.gov. \r\n For more upcoming events and Webinars I’d like to thank our speakers James and Greg for their excellent presentation. And of course our participants for joining us thank you everybody and good bye. \r\n END \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-14","title":"Market Opportunities in Turkey","update_date":"2013-05-14","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Turkey"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"486","content":" Certain documents need to be prepared correctly in order to get your goods delivered to your customer.

(Gives queuing instructions.) I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Barbara Lapini. Ma’am, you may begin. \r\n BARBARA LAPINI: Good morning to our participants in the United States and good evening to our speakers in India. Thank you for joining us for our webinar on getting your products into India and understanding Indian customs. I’m pleased to note that we have more than 80 people registered for the webinar today. My name is Barbara Lapini. I’m an international trade specialist with the India Business Center of the Trade Information Center. \r\n The Trade Information Center is part of the U.S. commercial service of the Department of Commerce. I’d like to welcome all the U.S. commercial service clients and other webinar participants in the exporting community who are joining us from across the United States to learn about Indian customs. \r\n Our speakers include: Dr. Abdul Shaikh, senior economist with the India Business Center of the Trade Information Center; Ms. Aileen Nandi, principal commercial officer with the U.S. Commercial Service in Chennai, India; Mr. Vijay Anand, customs manager for India with Expediters International; Mr. Vimal Rawat, manager of planning, engineering and operation support with FedEx in India. \r\n All the speakers will be available at the end of the presentations to answer your questions.

This will be operator-assisted. The operation will put you in queue to have your line taken off mute to ask a question. \r\n Now, without further ado, I’d like to introduce our first speaker, Dr. Abdul Shaikh, senior economist at the India Business Center. Abdul? \r\n ABDUL SHAIKH: Thank you, Barbara. And good morning and good evening to our speakers in India and all the folks who joined us from the United States. As Barbara said, that – we have a India Business Center, which is opened recently because of the significance of doing business in India, and more and more American companies and clients are looking for information. \r\n So today’s focus is more how to get your products across the borders in India. But before that – we focus on it, I thought I would give you kind of a brief overview of opportunities and challenges of doing business in India. \r\n The first thing is why we need to focus on India; you know, India is considered one of the megamarkets and one of the BRIC countries, where the United States is focusing on increasing exports, and India is one of them. And it is one of the fastest growing free market economies. For the last several years, it has been growing very rapidly. Even during the time of world recession, India continues to grow, and Indians are looking for U.S. products because the U.S. have competitive advantage in large number of products that you folks in America produce. \r\n This is a map of India, and you can see India has 29 states and six union territories, and the southern part of India is more prosperous and industrialized, so obviously, the markets are more fertile. And then the western part of India is also more prosperous and industrialized as well. So we have several of these trade missions we undertake from time to time to take American companies to India. \r\n The few facts I think many of you may be familiar with that India is very highly populated. It has more than three times of the U.S. population, close to 1.2 billion, and with one-third of the U.S. territory. So you can see the congestion when you go to India. It is the sixth-largest country in terms of purchasing power, and more strikingly, it has a large and growing middle class population, which is a very good market for U.S. products. And it is easier to do business in India because English is widely spoken, and English, I think – the British have left one good legacy, that is the language. So they really enjoy the fruits of that. \r\n India’s GDP has been growing rapidly, as I said, and more than 100 Fortune companies have their R\u0026amp;D operations because India is now considered to be the intellectual capital of Asia. \r\n As I said, that – we have a website, export.gov/india, and this is the India Business Center. Everything that you want to know about India and doing business with India and that information is available on this website, and we update that with the help of our colleagues in India and also other organizations in India as well as in the United States. \r\n So if you want to start from the beginning, then you can understand what is the basic of exporting, how to start trading with India. And we have – last time I was looking at – there were more than 4,000 market research reports on various industries that are also posted on the website. And you can also find the duties and tariffs because that is one of the important components that you need to know, how much India taxes or levies tariffs because it is a very complex mechanism, and still India is one of the highest tariff countries. \r\n We also post all the trade events – you know, any places that is taking place in the trade missions. We – I think importantly for you, if you are looking to sell products, we also have trade leads on that, and we post webinars as well. \r\n India is growing market. Nevertheless, it is only the 17th largest export market. As you can see that, of course, our neighbors are the largest exporters followed by China, and India is 17th. But I think what is important is the rate at which India’s U.S. exports to India is growing is more important. And as I said, that its rapidly growing middle class, I think one of the important features of Indian economy is that it is driven by domestic consumption, unlike China. As you can see, 62 percent of the GDP in India is due to private consumption. So there are consumers and they are looking for various products and services that the Americans make. And 71 percent of the population is under 35, and they are very Internet-savvy, educated and they are looking for American products. \r\n And it is a growing market. It also is very challenging, and the private sectors and entrepreneurship is also growing. So there is a greater opportunity for alliances, joint ventures for American companies if they are looking for it. \r\n And we have a network to assist you both in the United States and overseas. We have trade specialists in 108 U.S. cities. I think many of you have joined from different cities in the United States. We have local district export centers of the U.S. Department of Commerce commercial service. We also have 150 posts in 80 countries, including in India. I think Aileen will talk about more of those offices in India, how they can help you. \r\n Now these offices both in the U.S. and overseas can help you to locate international buyers, distributors and agents; provide expert help at every stage of that; and also help you to enter the market. So we are here to help you, and I think I also want to mention at this point that we have toll-free hotline that you can call in. A live person will answer your questions, and that number is 1-800-USATRADE. And this is the commercial service, I think I will let Aileen talk more about that. \r\n Now, even though the opportunities are striking in India, but there are also a lot of challenges, and you have to be very careful in doing business in India. Today, you know, there is a lot of government interference at all levels. As I said, there is a high tariff in excess to indirect taxes, some restrictions on foreign investments, although they are liberalizing. And more and more American companies are opening up for business, including Wal-Mart has opened a wholesale outlet in Gurgaon. \r\n There are also some problems in terms of the intellectual properties, so you have to be careful if you have an IPR or patent and trademark that you want to protect it. It is also a problem in India doing business because of lack of infrastructure, even though, you know, it is growing. The airports are multiplying, more passengers are traveling, but still, you’re getting from one place to the other, and if any of you have recently visited and traveling by car from one location in a city like Bangalore or Mumbai or New Delhi, you’ll find that the traffic congestions. And to add that, I think that Tata has added a new small car, so more and more millions of Indians are planning to buy that. And it costs only $2,400. \r\n There’s still some corruptions and custom regulations, and my colleagues and the – who are experts from India will talk more about the customs regulations in a few minutes. \r\n And to facilitate, I’ll list some of the tips for doing business in India because it is important to find a good partner so he can help you to do due diligence and screen out from – the good from the bad and so that you can deal with the companies or the parties where you want to do business. We can also help you to understand the market and competition because we have market research reports, we have folks in India commercial service can help you as well. \r\n It is important to do good planning and aggressive due diligence, but it also needs patience and commitment on your part because things don’t happen as rapidly as we are familiar in the United States. We don’t get instant results in India. And you need to get export counseling, we are here to help you and you can call Trade Information Center, India Business Center at 1-800-USATRADE. And it is equally important to understand the rules and regulations and standards, and they can be very complex, and unless you know those regulations, it is very difficult to be successful in India. \r\n And especially the documentation, I think, the customs require extensive, which has problems in free flow of trade across the borders. There are complex tariff structure, multiple exemptions and there is also various export promotion programs, and the enterprise zones where you locate your company, and all of that information is essential. These documentations I’m going to skip because I think our custom people will talk more about that. \r\n Now, this is a kind – the last slide, that is the World Bank conducts surveys of all the countries in the world to determine how easy to do business in India. And India has made significant progress from 2007 to 2008, but still, it is a long way to go, particularly, you know, the – dealing with licenses and you’re taking the products across borders, which has – trading across borders, as you can see, was 142 (rangs ?) but it has gong to 79. \r\n So there is a significant improvement, and India is trying to improve their customs – other regulations besides other problems that they encounter because they are now realizing that, unless they improve the regulatory environment, it is very difficult to attract foreign investment and foreign business. \r\n So that is kind of a quick overview, and my colleague from Chennai will – will give you the view from the Indian side. Thank you very much, and – \r\n MS. LAPINI: Thank you very much, Abdul. That was – for your – that very interesting presentation. And now, I’d like to introduce Aileen Nandi, the principal commercial officer with the U.S. Commercial Service in Chennai. Aileen? \r\n AILEEN NANDI: Thank you, Barbara and Abdul. Good morning, everyone, and I’d like to thank you all for joining us. I’m going to just talk very briefly – since Abdul gave an overview of doing business in India – of how we can help you succeed in the market. I’m having trouble forwarding my slides – \r\n MS. LAPINI: Hang on, Aileen. Let me see if I can – there you go. \r\n MS. NANDI: Thank you. \r\n Basically, we are part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. We work closely with our colleagues in the Indian Business Center. And we are here to help you make sales to the Indian market. Next slide. \r\n We have offices in seven cities throughout India, and some of the major ports that we deal with – work with are here in Chennai – Bombay and, of course, the capital city, Delhi, where a lot of cargo sites arrive in. But there are minor ports all throughout the country and, of course, most of the major – all the major cities and many minor cities have international airport facilities. Next slide. \r\n This shows you the Indo-U.S. trade. You know, before 2001, we – people used to joke that trade was as flat as the japappy (ph). And then you can really see how it’s taken off, where every year, the bilateral trade would increase by 20 (percent) to 30 percent and – so now it’s a very robust $44.5 billion. 2009 has shown a little bit of a weakening of about 2.9 percent, but what’s important to remember from the Indian perspective is that their – Indian exports to the United States have dropped substantially. \r\n This afternoon – I happen to spend most of my afternoon actually at the customs office here and they said that Indian exports to the United States were down by as much as 40 percent, and this could actually explain why we’re seeing a little bit of a(n) uptick in terms of customs issues, although I have to say as I’ve been here in Chennai for one year, and I just had several issues pop up in the past week. So I’m not sure if it’s – they have more time to scrutinize the incoming or even outbound shipments or what that issue is, but we are seeing an uptake. Next slide. \r\n And this is just showing investment – U.S. investment in India. And what’s interesting here is that the smaller portion, you can see Indian companies are increasingly more confident on the global stage and investing more in the United States. Next slide, please? \r\n So we can help you basically by doing matchmaking; working at trade shows and missions; counseling, as Abdul mentioned. And if you have something stuck in customs and you can’t get it out, give us a call and we can help work with our partners here to find out what the problem is and get it – because, of course, nobody wants to pay even more charges and everybody wants to get their shipments released. So we can help you do that. Next slide. \r\n Again, my contact information will be released at the end. I just wanted to make this short and sweet because the – I know you’re all here to listen to the – the service experts. So please contact us if you have issues or need any assistance in selling to the Indian market. We’d be very happy to help you. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Thank you, Aileen, for that interesting overview of what the U.S. commercial service can do in India to help U.S. exporters. \r\n Our next speaker will be Mr. Vijay Anand, customs manager with – for India with Expeditors International. Mr. Anand? \r\n VIJAY ANAND: Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for giving us this opportunity. \r\n Let me give you an overview about Indian customs brokerage setup. I think the slide is not moving, Barbara. \r\n MS. LAPINI: There we go. \r\n MR. ANAND: Okay. Just to give an idea about the agenda of this presentation, this first one will – or will be about the regulatory for customs and the next one is about understanding the Indian duty structure. The next one will be the requirements to do ex-im in India. What I mean by ex-im India is exports and imports in India. And then import customs clearance process and export customs clearance process and special themes available provided by the government of India and the special privileged areas. So let us see the regulatory first. \r\n The Indian regulatory is called Central Board of Excise and Customs. They formulate the policy concerning the levy and collection of, you know, customs and excise duties and also to prevent the smuggling and administrational matters relating to customs and excise – (inaudible) – and narcotics. And they are the administrative authorities of customs – (inaudible) – and central revenues control laboratory. \r\n They come under the Ministry of Finance, and under the Ministry of Finance, we have three departments. The first one is the Department of Economic Affairs, the next one is the Department of Revenue and the third one is the Department of Expenditure. CBEC, the Central Board of Excise and Customs comes under the Department of Revenue. The next one, please? \r\n Just to give an idea of what – (background noise) – custom duty is kind of an imbedded tax, which is released on the goods of international trade. In economic terms, it is also called as the consumption tax. There’s a duty levied by the government in relation to the goods which is imported. It is also known as the import duty. In the same vein, duties released on export consignment is called export duty. \r\n There are certain items that get exported out of India that attract a duty. Tariffs, which is actually a list of commodities along with a leviable rate of customs popularly understood as customs duties. And there’s also another one called the excise tax, which is basically for goods when it is getting exported out of India. And these are, you know, like levied on the manufacturer of goods when these goods leave the place of manufacture. It’s – earlier, it was known as, you know, as central excise duty and also known as the CENVAT. \r\n Manufacturers are allowed to offset the duty paid on materials used in the manufacturing process. We’re using the duty as a credit against the excise tax through a process known as CENVAT credit. What it means is like if you import a good into India for the raw materials and if you have paid a duty for it, and when you export the finished good, you can adjust the – you know, a proportion or the – you know, the percentage of duty which you have already paid when you do the exports out of India. Next slide please? \r\n Just to give you an idea about the Indian duty structure, I mean, any dutiable good will basically attract the first four duties in the black, which is basically the basic duty of customs; the next one is the countervailing duty; the third one is the additional customs duty; and the fourth one is education cess. So any dutiable good will attract, you know, any of – I mean, all these four. And there are also other duties, which is known as – you know, like the effect duty – I mean, if customs or the government decides to effect a particular percentage of duty on a particular commodity or tariff, they can issue a notice and effect a different duty for this particular product. \r\n And there are preferential rate of duties which are basically, you know, with relevance to the free trade agreement we have with different countries, you know. And these countries have a discounted duty structure of, you know, whatever. So these are coming under the preferential rate of duty. And, of course, the third one we all know is anti-dumping duty. If any commodity which is imported into India – I mean, if the price of that particular commodity is lower than the world market level, then the customs will impose an anti-dumping duty. \r\n And the fourth one is the safeguard duty. I mean, the Indian customs has, you know, a list of developed nations in terms of their import into India. If any one particular country’s (aggregating posts ?) goes over 3 percent, then a safeguard duty is imposed. And the other scenario is the aggregate of all the developed nations’ countries’ imports exceeds by 9 percent, then there is an application of safeguard duty as well. Next slide please. \r\n Just to give you an idea of what the process in terms of the custom clearance. I mean, the way it is done – as you know, the original import document list – this slide is about the import custom clearance. Fortunately, four document are required to – (inaudible) – and the customs, if you know – I mean, you can find the bill of entry or the import entry through EDA. And after the arrival of the vessel at the seaport, the bill of entry will be assessed by the customs, and customs duty and taxes will be paid. \r\n When you have the receipt or delivery order from the steamship line and the – you know, forward that and the customs examination will be completed at the CFS. Lead and container cargo shall be removed from CFS for delivery to (containment ?) – factory. Normally, the process takes between one to three days for a sealed container, however, but one to two working days for the custom clearance and delivery planning. \r\n Now, most of the companies or the customers in India will prefer to clear the goods within three days because the (free time ?) – a load in the seaport or the customs is only three working days. So anything goes beyond three days, you will have to, you know, end up paying (damages ?). So more often it is all cleared under three days if there is no issues on the documentation. Next slide please? \r\n Okay, this is on the add import clearance process. Similarly, like – I mean, on the add phrase part, customs will accept copies. On the sea freight part, you need the original documents to clear the goods, but on the add import parts, copies is enough. Similarly, the EB, the bill of entry or the import entry is filed with the customs. After arrival of the flight at the airport, the bill of entry will be assessed at customs, and you pay the duty and taxes, receive delivery order from the airline and forward it, and customs examination will be completed at the airport. \r\n Cargo will be moved out of the airport for delivery to (containers ?) location. The lead time to do this activity normally takes between one to two working days, and even on the add import front, the free time available is only for three days. And in India, most of the international flights, I would say like 70 (percent) to 80 percent of the international flights land only in the midnight. So normally the process goes to the second day of the arrival, and by the same day’s evening, I mean, you’ll be in a position to clear customs and remove the freight out of airport. Next slide please? \r\n This is for the process on export – I mean, just wanted to share it with you, but I know most of the customers are planning to do imports into India, but the export process is very, very simple in India, both on the air front as well as the sea front. It normally takes about one to two working days to do custom clearance, and the document required are the – (inaudible) – packing list, IEC number, AD code and bank (retail ?) – numbers. \r\n The IEC, area code, description will come in the following slides, and the export entry is called shipping bill. It’s a name filed through the EDA in the area of sea customs and customs assessment will be carried out in the airport or seaport. \r\n The (factories ?) of containers will be moved to the seaport for the cargo for air shipment will be moved to the airport. If you have an LCL shipment, it will moved to a CFS, and then the stuffing happens in the container freight station. On an LCL container, the seal is verified, cargo is examined for an LCL cargo and the airport for air shipments with a customs officer. \r\n The export processes are very, very simple. If all the documentation are perfect, you can even clear customs on an export within three to four hours subject to the documentations, you know, remaining perfect. \r\n And finally, once the customs officer assesses it, he gives the “let export,” you know, certificate, and the container will be handed over to the cargo – I mean, the carrier or the air freight shipment will be handed over to the carrier. Normally – I mean, 90 percent of the export shipments are cleared within one day, but some cases, this may go to the second day as well. Next slide, please? \r\n Just to give you an idea of what it’s – imported – I mean, IEC port and the authorized dealer code and the business identification number, these are the basic requirements to do imports or exports in India. The import or exporter code is nothing but a code given by the director-general of foreign trade. Only when you have this code you are allowed to do export or import. And this can be – earlier, it used to be available at the central office in Delhi, but now they have regional licensing authorities in all the 29 states. \r\n The next one is every exporter – authorized dealer code – every exporter who’s involved in a foreign transaction should have a bank account, and this account should be informed to Indian customs and through the Bank of India, which is a federal bank, allots a code to each bank. And this code is called an authorized dealer code. \r\n Customs links your IEC number and the AD code together, and the exporter also requested – I mean, required to register authorized foreign exchange dealer and open a current account in the designated bank. And all the drawback incentives are credited in these bank accounts. \r\n The third one is the business identification number. The exporters have to obtain and, based on identification number, from the director-general of foreign trade. Without a bin number, you cannot file a shipping bill for clearance of exporters. Under the EDA system (land-based ?) businesses receives online with a custom system from the DGFT. So these three are the mandatory requirements before even you start, you know, doing your imports or exports in India. Next slide, please? \r\n There are 1,000 schemes forwarded by the Indian customs in order to reduce your duty or, you know, take a resumption of duty or, you know, to control your duty payout or whatever. As Mr. – Dr. Abdul said, like, the tariffs are very high in India, and the duties are still a little complex, and in order to, you know, help the exporters or importers, you know, there are certain schemes which allows them to reduce the duty or even go for a free, you know, duty structure. \r\n First one is the advanced license scheme. This allows you to free import of imports which are specifically incorporated in the export product making, and you have a normal allowance for – (inaudible) – with a specific export obligation in terms of value and quantity. What it means is you can go for an advanced license, but you can go for a duty free aspect in this but you need to – you know, you have an obligation in terms of exporting an extra amount of, you know, value and by showing that – (background noise) – in an advanced license. \r\n The next one is the export promotion of capital growth, allows the import of capital goods alone for pre-production, production, post-production, including, you know, CKD (ph) and SKD (ph) – (inaudible) – computer software systems at 3 percent customs duty subject to an export obligation equivalent to eight times. It means if you’re asking for a – for example, if your duty is, say, $100,000 in a year, you have to fulfill an export obligation of, you know, $800,000 on the export. So this has been monitored and recorded and registered as maintained, and this particular scheme, you know, is very popular in India. A lot of companies bring their capital goods under this scheme. \r\n The next one is duty entitlement passbook scheme. This is to neutralize the incidence of customs duty on import content of export products, and the exporter is entitled for a duty credit as a specified percentage of freight onboard. Again, this has to be applied through the – you know, director-general of foreign trade. And the fourth one is the duty drawback scheme for those transactions in which goods are placed in specific categories of beneficiaries to leave the country, and the payment for such supplies is received in either in Indian rupees or foreign exchange. \r\n Fourth one is the deemed export. This refers to the transaction in which goods supplied do not leave country. For example, we have a lot of special economic zones in India, and these special economic zones are as good as foreign countries, there is no duty or taxes involved. Now, if you have to supply to these special economic zones inside India, it is considered as deemed exports, and payment of such supplies is received in Indian rupees or foreign exchange. Next slide, please? \r\n Just to give an idea about the (privileged ?) areas provided by the Indian government, Pashtwan (ph) is the most populous special economic zone in India. This is specifically dealing duty free and clear. It is as good as a foreign country and for the purpose of trade operations and duties and tariffs. These units can import procure from domestic tariff area all types of goods and services without payment of duty. That means there is zero duty for this – nothing applies to that. And apart from this, you have export-orient units, electronic hardware technology parts deemed, software technology parts deemed or biotechnology parts deemed. So these schemes are all operating under duty free regime for import procurement of all types of goods, including capital goods without payment of duty for manufacture of goods for exports. \r\n Now, these schemes are provided only when you have an obligation for export, so this is something which you need to keep in mind. And the next one which is developing is a free trade warehousing zone, which is on the anvil – Indian government is planning to promote a free trade warehousing zone, and this infrastructure will also allow you to, you know, bring in goods from various neighboring countries and do a consolidation in India and then export it out. So this is likely to be starting in the middle of 2010, and most of the customers are, you know, looking eager for this particular scheme. Next one, please? \r\n So that’s about it. If you have any questions, you can throw it back to us. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Thank you very much for that very substantial presentation, Mr. Anand. \r\n Our next speaker will be Mr. Vimal Rawat of – who’s the manager of planning, engineering and operation support with Federal Express, FedEx, in India. Mr. Rawat? \r\n VIMAL RAWAT: Yeah, good morning, everyone in the U.S. and good evening for participants from India. Barbara, can I control the movement of the slides? \r\n MS. LAPINI: You can. Just let me know if you have any problems. Okay. \r\n MR. RAWAT: (Off mic.) Okay. \r\n Now, what I want to cover, a lot of, Mr. Anand has covered, so I’ll be really quick on those areas. The subject that I want to cover here is just trade regulators and CB fees (ph) and fee responsibilities of customs – (inaudible) – ratification and understanding principles of restrictions, import and export governments – (inaudible) – export and import clearances. \r\n (Inaudible) – normally the credit (qualities ?) are governed by the Ministry of Commerce. They have Department of Commerce and the – most important for exporting – (inaudible) – of foreign trade. And they govern – the export-import policy is governed by the Ministry of Commerce. And the Department of Commerce is headed by a secretary, and they’re responsible for the country’s external trade, formulating the trade policies. \r\n And DGFT, director-general of foreign trade, is under Department of Commerce, and they have active participation in foreign trade policies. And the IEC Code, the Import Export Code, it’s like – you have EIN number in the U.S.; that’s similar. Every company wants to import and export, they must have an IEC. \r\n Import/export licenses and standard input/output norms, they are formulated for various (drawback scheme ?)s. So all these are the key responsibilities of the DGFT. \r\n Now, the customs department is under Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue. And then under Department of Revenue, there is Central Board of Excise and Customs, who govern the Customs Department. And customs – there is a chairman of CBEC, and under him for customs is member, customs. These are the – for customs policy at a ministry level. They formulate the customs and excise duty tariffs and rates, protection of domestic industry, prevention of smuggling, administrative matters, and they have the administrative authority for their subordinate organizations. \r\n Those include the custom houses, who are actually – they also call them field commissions. They are the ones who are at the airports and seaports clearing the shipments. \r\n The key responsibility of customs is collection of customs duties, safeguarding the financial interests and implementing the policies and procedures framed by the Ministry of Commerce. So the national economic commercial interests, economic and commercial (force ?), regulating international trade within foreign trade guidelines, and illicit trafficking, they have to keep track on that. \r\n The classification of goods. Whether it’s import or export, classification is the first step that needs to go in there. And India is a participant in WTO and we adopted the WTO classification coding system way back in 1986. And our – the customs and excise tariffs have to be aligned with – (inaudible) – codes. And a nomenclature combining – (inaudible) – is called – we call it (tariffs ?). So the only differential between the customs tariffs in U.S. and India would be the rate of duty; otherwise, the classification, what you adopt, is the same that we adopt in India. \r\n And this tariff part is governed by direct act, and that’s called tariffs – (inaudible). They’re for importing to India and even exports more regarding the imports because there are very few restrictions of exports. So mainly, you can classify them, all the goods, in three major categories. One is – (inaudible/background noise) – imports a week, or they also call it open (daily license ?) and you don’t need any license to import commodities. These can be imported and exported free, and it’s – (background noise) – on import and export of these commodities. \r\n (Registered ?) commodities are where you require a license or a certificate or a permission. And then fines and penalties may apply for – (inaudible) – that you cannot import and export into India. Now, the principle of restriction are the – protecting the public morals and protecting the human and animal or plant life or health; protection of patents, trademarks and copyrights; prevention of use of prison labor. So these are the various principles by which the restrictions are governed. \r\n Then import and exports. As far as the law is concerned, they are governed by a customs act, which was the 1962 Customs Tariff Act. Like I mentioned earlier, that’s the duty rates and all. Foreign trade policy, the (five-year ?) policy that is put down by the Ministry of Commerce – (inaudible) – like everywhere in the world now, the – (inaudible) – arms act, we have some cosmetics acts for cosmetics. \r\n And then there are some state government rules and regulations that Dr. Abdul in his presentation, he was talking about some across borders – so India has 29 states. So if not 29, so then at least do that for – around 15 states where their – (inaudible) – entries are also governed by certain rules, regulations, permissions and the entry permits. \r\n Just to give you a brief on the import and export clearance on the air transportation, there are two main categories in air transportation, the experts, or the (career mode ?) they call, and then we have the formal entry or the entries – (inaudible) – cargo mode. So there are three main governing areas of – (inaudible) – contents, gems and jewelry, and anything related to the export promotion schemes like Mr. Anand mentioned in detail, and repair and – (inaudible). \r\n So these categories, they can clear in express mode if it requires a formal entry. And if the – on the export side, the samples valuing more than 50,000 (dollars), valuing more than 25,000 (dollars) or anything with a – (audio break) – transaction, again, a formal exit from the country, and – (inaudible) – these shipments weighing more than 32 kgs or dimensions. These are basically – the weight and size are, by the airline security they put. So these three categories, you need a formal exit from the country. I’m sorry – it should be formal exit, not entry. \r\n And similarly on the import side. If the low-value document – low value and medium value, these three categories that are shown in this presentation, they are – they don’t require a formal entry, can be cleared on express or – (inaudible) – country. However, the high value requires a formal entry. \r\n So documents, they just – (express ?), you just make one simple declaration for documents, and low value is gifts and samples up to 10,000 rupees or $200. And there doesn’t follow the de minimis entirely. We have a selective de minimis, I would say, for – it’s for samples and gifts up to $200. If it is not a sample, not a gift and the value is still within $200, it doesn’t fall under de minimis, there is a duty on it. \r\n So that selective de minimis on low value will – that – it can become express mode. The medium value, that is more than 10,000 rupees or 200 (dollars) – between 200 (dollars) to $2,000, they are cleared on, again, express entry, with examination and duty rated as applicable. The higher end do require a formal entry. So the value that I’ve mentioned about here, $200, $2,000, this is the landed value of the goods. So it’s not a declared value, it’s declared value plus insurance plus freight plus 1 percent port status. \r\n Now, here I’ve given a little bit of comparison on express and formal entry, the paperwork and the – procedure-wise. On express clearance, we have the provision of three clearance. So before arrival of the flight, the assessment and the release can be procured from customs. \r\n So on arrival, they do examinations and final release. However, in formal entry, the clearance process is – it’s not as simple as in the express entry. And 90 percent of the shipments arriving in express mode are cleared within four to six hours of arrival. However, on formal entry, it may take one day, at least. Clearance up to 100,000, that is the restriction on express mode of clearance. However, on the formal side, there is no value limit. \r\n Consignee participation is required on – (audio break) – only more than $2,000. However, every entry on formal entry you need consignee participation – documents from consignee, the authorization letters and the value – (inaudible). The express clearance in Delhi and Bombay are 24/7, and the clearances under the license if the consignee’s importer is (providing ?) any benefit, then that is not permissible on the (express side ?), it has to be on the formal entry. And duty – normally, the express companies, they advance the duty on behalf of the customer and take the reimbursement on daily rates. And as practiced normally, the – on the formal side it’s the consignee who advances the duty. \r\n So the main import clearance paperwork, other – there are more, but those are more specific to the – (inaudible) – commodities. This is the general paperwork that you will need for all kinds of shipments, airbill, commercial invoice, packing list, IEC and (the authority ?) letter from consignee that is required on the express side only more than $2,000. However, on the formal clearance side, you need it for each and every shipment. And the same goes with the valuation declaration. \r\n The main, (same ?) points that we have on import clearances, not everything is attributed to customs. There are other regulators, like airport regulators and all. There are also – there are procedures and also costs from delays. The IGM filing delays – or the import manifest needs to filed by the carrier at least four hours before arrival of the flight. So if that is delayed – that is the starting point for the import clearance. That needs to be filed first. And then if – because on the cargo side, the cargo arrival notice or the delivery order in case consignees are paying for his own broker to clear. If that is delayed the entire process gets delayed. \r\n On the airport side, the segregation and location allocation – like Mr. Anand said, most of the flights arrive during the night, so that – that delays the process. And the shipment getting into the warehouse and getting the location. And without that, the examination cannot start. \r\n On the clearance delay, the disputes are not only on valuation and classification, plus the other regulatory bodies like EDC – (inaudible) – or any licenses, those are the main areas where – (inaudible) – on import happens. \r\n On export, I have not touched too much. We can – on the express side, it’s just about a three-hour activity, and on the enforcement side – (inaudible). \r\n That’s all I have. And my contact details. If anybody has questions, can please contact me. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Rawat for that very interesting presentation with lots of good information, I think, from all of our speakers. \r\n At this point, we will have question-and-answer time. Operator? Christine, are you there? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes, ma’am. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Can you open up the lines for questions for us? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes, thank you. At this time, we’d like to begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n The first question comes from Patty Ellison (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Are express bill (waitings/weightings ?) allowed to clear shipments in India on ocean? \r\n MS. LAPINI: Can I ask one of our customs experts to answer that? \r\n MR. ANAND: Yes, it is allowed. \r\n Q: Okay. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from John Balsom (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes, thank you. This is a question dealing with getting a (RMA ?) – made unit back out of India to our office. We basically shipped a network appliance that has a standard computer server with proprietary software on it. So we originally sold and imported into India a number of the units at full value, and – although they asked us to break out the hardware portion with a software portion; we normally don’t do that, but we did in this case. \r\n One of those units failed just recently. We shipped a replacement unit to them; in our cases, we ship at whatever the insured value is, which is really just the cost of the software – excuse me, the hardware in that case. Got the unit in successfully, and the value was, for example, $3,000, where the original cost was 20,000 (dollars) that was on the original commercial invoice. \r\n But now we can’t get the unit back out because our customers say that they need to value that unit at, like, $20,000, and we’re concerned that we’ll end up paying some type of a tax or duty on that value versus the value of the unit that we actually replaced with it. \r\n So my question is, what do we – what should we value that unit that we need to get returned back from India? \r\n MR. RAWAT: How long back this original unit was brought into India? \r\n Q: Well, it was imported last year, and we’ve imported probably 15 of those units, and this is just one unit that failed. And we already replaced it; we already sent them a new unit. We’re just trying to get the old unit back out. And there’s a difference – we have a conflict, I guess, in how much we should value that unit for. \r\n And we don’t really care what they value it, as long as we’re not responsible for any type of duty or tariff on the way back out. \r\n MR. RAWAT: But there are no export duties out of India. \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MR. RAWAT: The valuation they’d need for the export documentation, and if it was – it’s an old unit, they can always use the depreciated value – \r\n Q: Mm hmm. \r\n MR. RAWAT: – and, accordingly, they can export it out. And – (inaudible) – they’re going to pay it on the – (inaudible) – that they should have a weighted – and could have sent the unit back out there. But they can export it, but there is no export duty in that. \r\n Q: Okay. So – I mean, just to clarify. We valued the replacement unit at $3,000. We thought that that’s what they should value it – when they’re asking for a value, that they should value it at $3,000 to get it back out of the country. But they seem to think that they need to value it at whatever the original cost was. \r\n MR. RAWAT: Three thousand dollars is the original cost? \r\n Q: No, $20,000 was the original cost, and that was on the original commercial invoice when they first imported it last year. We got a replacement unit in to them at – with a $3,000 value because that’s just the cost of the hardware, and that’s what we said that should be the value that they place on the faulty unit to ship it back out. And they seem to think that they need to put the original value of $20,000 on that unit. That’s what we can’t understand. \r\n MR. RAWAT: Yeah, I think that’s right. And they have to – all they can do is depreciate – the one-year depreciation on it, and – \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MR. RAWAT: – the value around – whatever the depreciation (is ?), they must be placing – if it is five years, then 4,000 (dollars) less, then 15,000 (dollars) can be the depreciated value. \r\n Q: Okay. All right. Thank you. \r\n MR. RAWAT: Sure. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Steve Schaud (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes. I was just wondering what’s the price differential between express clearance and your normal clearance, that last item that they covered? How much more does it cost to do express clearance? \r\n MR. RAWAT: The clearance cost, I would say, on the express side – normally, the clearance cost is included in your transportation. \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MR. RAWAT: And the duties and the taxes are the same on both sides. (Inaudible) – that is followed on express as a – (inaudible). For express clearance, which is a $2,000 – there is no – no clearance cost there separately. \r\n Q: Okay. All right. Thank you. \r\n MR. RAWAT: Sure. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Ken Ansell (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: On the documentation required to enter the country, I know there’s value declaration. Can you explain what constitutes value declaration and – in particular when shipping used equipment into the country as well as new. \r\n And then a secondary question is does customs apply interest on the duties when the equipment is in bonded warehouses? \r\n MR. ANAND: Yeah. When the cargo is imported into India and it is getting bonded in a warehouse, the customs give 90 days’ interest free. This – and after 90 days, it is 15 percent per annum on the duty mode, which is being levied by the customs at interest. \r\n Q: Now, what about the value declaration? What constitutes value declarations? What is accepted? \r\n MR. ANAND: Are you talking about the second-hand machinery or the new machineries? \r\n Q: Both. \r\n MR. ANAND: I mean, the value declaration for a new one is your actual value which you declare in the commercial invoice, but customs also has, you know, the identical rates of those equipments in India. So if it matches with that, then it works fine. \r\n But when it comes to a secondhand machinery, I mean, it depends on, you know, how you depreciate the value of used machinery. Normally, customs allows you to depreciate up to 70 percent of the – you know, the original value of the used machinery, not beyond that. But even then, whenever a secondhand machinery comes inside India, customs has authorized 35 chartered engineers. \r\n So these chartered engineers will assess the used machinery, and they give the value of the – I mean they make an assessment and, you know, come at a – arrive at a value, and this value must be announced to customs and the importer. So irrespective of if the value depreciates 50 percent or 70 percent, the chartered engineer’s certification or the assessment of the value is final. \r\n Q: On new equipment, what is acceptable for a declaration? The commercial invoice has not been acceptable in the past. We’ve had to provide additional value declarations, and that’s been a bit confusing. \r\n MR. ANAND: For used machinery importation into India, the chartered engineers which have been listed by the customs, they will give these values. They will assess the car – I mean equipment, and they will recommend the value for the customs. So the invoice value, the chartered-engineer-given value and the customs transaction value, whichever is the highest, the customs will levy duty on the higher value. This is one area. \r\n And the other area is, the customs always – (inaudible) – transaction value rules for all the new products, okay, even if you have – (inaudible) – a new machine or new equipment which is coming into India, and that the value declared in your invoice should match with the value that – the record placed on the customs. If that is the case, the customs will very well accept your invoice value and levy duty on that. \r\n Q: But we’ve been asked for product catalogues and documentations of published pricing list and that type of thing. And not all of our manufacturers have published price lists, so it’s been a matter of how do we generate a price list when we don’t have a publicly published price list. \r\n MR. ANAND: Okay. This will be a case where you bring in the machinery. And is it a new kind of sophisticated machinery? \r\n Q: It’s new equipment. Sophisticated, I don’t know the answer to that question. \r\n MR. ANAND: Because, I mean, if there is no transaction price available for a particular equipment when it arrives, in that case customs may request to provide the product catalogue and then, you know, the price list. But otherwise, predominantly most of the assessment happens with the commercial invoice of the customer, unless if the equipment is new into India and there is no transaction value for it in the customs. \r\n Q: Okay. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: Your next question comes from Jose Whitman (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Hi. Thank you. I have a couple questions, actually. Number one, I have a similar situation like the one just expressed. We just sent a couple samples to India from one of our customers. The value of the product, real value is $85, and customs had assessed the value of the product for $715. It seems to me like customs doesn’t have any kind of – (word inaudible) – from there and they’re just checking Google or I have no idea how they’re getting to this. However, my customer is refusing to pay the duties for $715, because that will set a precedent for the next importation. \r\n Is there anything that can be done about that? We have a public price list. We can certify any price list with the chambers of commerce and so on. Is there anything that we can do about that? \r\n MR. : Has the duty been paid and shipment released? \r\n Q: No. No. The customer actually – we sent this by FedEx, and the customer actually refused the shipment because the customs duty was more than $250. And he was afraid of taking this and then setting the precedent in customs that the real value is $715, which is not the case on this product. \r\n This is not the first time that this has happened. \r\n MR. : (The $715 ?) – challenge first time value on that. Like you said, you have if you have some lists and some value evidence available. You can definitely challenge customs on the value if the documents you do provide to prove the value is $85. You can definitely do that. \r\n It was sent through FedEx, you said? \r\n Q: Yes. \r\n MR. : Okay. And you have my e-mail ID, and if you can send me the details, I’ll personally look into it. \r\n MR. : I think we can challenge it, yes. \r\n Q: Okay. Wonderful. \r\n And the last two questions is, first, about the free zone in India, it works like any other free zone all over the world? So the product basically is stationary in there and they pay duties only when it’s released into the country? \r\n MR. : Yeah. The free trade zone, as you said, it’s like any other free trade zone in the world. But if you want to sell it for the domestic market or for the Indian consumption, then you have to pay the local duty. \r\n Q: Okay. And on the event that there is no selling internally, could be re-exported? \r\n MR. : I beg your pardon? Can you please come again? \r\n Q: That in the event that the product is not consumed or sold into the domestic market in India, can I re-export that product to the region, to other countries? \r\n MR. : You can. You can. \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MR. : The free – the special economic zones or the free trade zones are basically foreign (countries ?) inside India. \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n MR. : So you can bring in, take it out. As long as you don’t sell it for domestic custom, you don’t have to pay any duties or taxes. \r\n Q: Okay. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Louis Rothberg (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes. My question is just simple. I was not able to write fast enough to get some of the excellent information. Will we be given a set of these charts? \r\n MS. LAPINI: Yes. I can answer that for you. Yes. I will be sending out the slides, and there will be a recorded version, also, of the webinar available afterwards. \r\n Q: All right. When can we anticipate receiving the slides? That’s it. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Within the next day. \r\n Q: All right. Thank you very much. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Abe Thomas (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yeah, hi. Thank you very much. \r\n We are exporters of musical instruments for education to India. In our case, we have shipped some harmonicas into India and that was being used by a customer, and one of the customers needed one of the harmonicas repaired. So we sent it out from India via EMS post and have an outbound EMS number for it. It went to Japan, Suzuki Japan, who repaired the harmonica and then sent it back via EMS post. And on the export declaration, they have marked clearly that this is a repaired harmonica, no commercial value, and with the marking of $5 for customs purposes. \r\n However, when it arrived in India, the customs officer assessed or asked our employee in Bangalore what the value of the product is, and he gave a rupee value of 6,000 rupees. And even though it was marked on there that it was a repaired harmonica brought back with no commercial value, they assessed a duty on it of approximately 1,900 rupees. \r\n And of course, after having visited these folks three or four times and spending three or four days there, I just told them, look, just pay the clearance fee because it was about 40 U.S. dollars; time is worth more money than this. \r\n So, you know, how do we avoid this for any type of future imports, where a product needs to be sent out for repair and needs to come back in, where we are not assessed duty twice on the same product? \r\n MR. RAWAT: On the express or the cargo side – on EMS, I’m not very aware, but on the express and cargo side, when we export anything for repair and it comes back, we declare at the time of export that this is going for a repair – (inaudible) – and the first import documentation should – (inaudible). \r\n The other thing which is very important in such cases is having a very visible – (inaudible) – number endorsed by customs, the serial numbers and all. At the time of import, the invoice that’s coming in should give the value of repair costs and transportation. That’s the only portion which is dutiable when it comes back in. \r\n Q: I see. Well, you know, this is – in India they call these mouth organs, harmonicas. There is no serial number on it. In fact, that is one of the questions that the customs officer asked: How do we know that this is not a new product and it is a repaired product? \r\n Well, there was one month’s worth of e-mail communications that took place on this thing from the customer to the factory, the factory requesting us to please send it back for repair. We presented all of those documents, and we told them there is no such thing as a serial number on this; however, here is the outbound EMS numbers. \r\n But, you know, this is interesting. You say that you are with FedEx, sir? (Pause.) Are you with FedEx? \r\n MR. RAWAT: Pardon me? \r\n Q: Are you with FedEx? \r\n MR. RAWAT: Yes, I am, sir. \r\n Q: Okay, so that’s great, because in the future this is something that we can use, because this way there is – you know, you just mentioned that for an export of this, you have to have a declaration. Well, at the postal service or at the EMS, we did not have any way to document that this was going out. However, we presented them the EMS number – \r\n MR. RAWAT: Yeah, that’s important, because – that’s very important to match. And recently our own equipment we sent out, and we paid a duty only on the repair cost. It was $1,800 that we imported from U.S. and for repairs, and the repair cost was just $25, and the transportation another $10, and on return it would be only on $35, not $1,800. \r\n Q: Is there any way to now go back to the customs – you know, the customer was quite upset to know about this aspect, but we took care of, you know, customer care, that we paid for it ourselves. We, by the way, have an office in India. (Inaudible) – corporation has opened an office in India and we have a presence there. And we wanted to give the same level of service that we give to customers here in the U.S. Therefore, we handled it ourselves. \r\n Now, if it was being sent to a customer directly, they do not have an import-export code number, do they? You know, a consumer. \r\n MR. RAWAT (?): If it is (personal ?) shipping, then the customs officer on the shift, the assistant commissioner, we just have to make a request to him; he allows on a customs IC code number. They have one reserved for such shipments. \r\n Q: I see. For direct to customers. \r\n MR. RAWAT (?): Yeah, for direct one-time importer who’s not a regular importer and exporter, he won’t have an IC code. So then we make a form request to the assistant commissioners of customs, and he allows them to file that entry on that particular code. \r\n Q: I see. Thank you very much for your - \r\n MR. RAWAT (?): And as far as – \r\n Q: Yeah, go ahead. \r\n MR. RAWAT (?): You’re welcome. \r\n As far as your question about could you go to customs back on your harmonica case, we can always challenge, but I don’t see too much for success coming on this, because there is no proof of export, the marks and numbers and – there’s no identification for that. So it can always be challenged, but the chances here of getting any reimbursement from customs in this particular case are, I think – (inaudible). \r\n Q: Well, you know, most of the mouth organs or the harmonicas do not have a marking on them, as far as a serial number is concerned. You know, how do we address that? How do you address it if one was to be sent out that way? We do have one harmonica, one mouth organ, that costs $3,000. That has a serial number on it. But there are other items, such as this, where – you know, most musical instruments don’t have – well, electronic instruments do, but I’m talking about, you know, mouth organs do not have serial numbers put on them. \r\n So how – \r\n MS. LAPINI: You know what, maybe should we – I think there are maybe other questions in queue. Can we talk about that specific case off-line? \r\n Q: Yes, surely can. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Is that okay, Mr. Thomas? \r\n Q: Yes. I appreciate your answers. You’ve given me some good tips on future shipments. We will contact you at FedEx. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Yeah. And you have the contact information and the direct e-mail, so you can follow up on that, certainly. \r\n Q: Thank you very much. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Thank you. \r\n Q: And thank you very much, Barbara, and thank you very much, everyone. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Okay. Operator, are there other questions? \r\n OPERATOR: Yes, ma’am. The next question comes from Amy Zacker (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Hi. My question is pretty simple. I just want to find out if original commercial invoices, original signed commercial invoices, are always required in India. \r\n MR. : Yes, it is always required for the sea shipments, but for air shipments, copies are fine. \r\n Q: Of the commercial invoice, not of the airway bill. \r\n MR. : Commercial invoice. \r\n Q: Okay. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Deloria (sp) Williams. You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes. We are actually re-exporters of a mosquito control product. And we’re buying goods exported from a factory in Karur and in full-container quantities, and what’s happening is our freight forwarder is shipping it from Karur to Chennai in trucks. And they said that they’re doing that because of the inspection that has to take place in Chennai. And what I suggested to them is to do it in containers, and they said that they could not do it. \r\n So I guess my question is, you know, what’s the reason behind this? And is there any other way that we could have them to ship containers and (stuff ?) them at the factory? \r\n MR. : What is the product, Madame? \r\n Q: They’re mosquito nets. \r\n MR. : Mosquito nets. \r\n Q: Yes. \r\n MR. : There are two types of inspection which can be effected. One type is the manufacturer in India can stuff the cargo in their barrels, in the containers, with the central excise or customs supervision, and that can be taken to Chennai port and can be exported. This is one way. \r\n The other way is they can move the cargo to Chennai container freight stations, keep the cargo there, do the customs examination, stuff the cargo in the container, and they can move it to the Chennai port. These are the two ways that the manufacturer can export. \r\n Q: Okay. So the second one, that’s basically what they’re doing now. They’re shipping trucks and then examining it and then stuffing it at the port. \r\n MR. : But you can prefer the first one also, but the exporter in India has to be registered in the jurisdiction’s central excise authority or the customs authority to carry out the customs examination in their own barrels. \r\n Q: Okay. What would be involved in doing that? What would be the cost to have that done, if any? \r\n MR. : It is just a registration. It is just a registration of the manufacturer with the customs jurisdictional authorities of customs and central excise. And they also make a special application after the registration to carry out the customs examination or central excise examination inside their barrels. And they been given a special authority also by the customs and the central excise to do the self – (inaudible) – in their own barrels. \r\n Q: Okay. So that official would just come and do the inspection. \r\n MR. : Inspection there. \r\n Q: Okay. \r\n And actually I had another question. This is just a short one. Where can we obtain an Indian national holiday schedule? \r\n MR. : Indian national – ? \r\n Q: The national holiday schedule so that we’ll know the holidays, because we always are finding out kind of after the fact that there’s a holiday there. \r\n MR. : There is not – the listed holidays as for the Indian government is only 12. But for customs, it varies. I mean, it varies from zone to zone. There is no uniform holiday for the whole of the Indian customs. It is different in Bombay, it is different in Chennai. So we can send it across to you. Not a problem. \r\n Q: You could send that? Okay. \r\n MR. : Tell me which is the location you’re looking for, so that that particular customs jurisdiction holiday list, I can send it across. \r\n Q: Okay. That will be for Chennai and for Haldia port. \r\n MR. : Okay. We can send it across. \r\n MS. LAPINI: So go ahead and maybe follow up by e-mail with one of our customs experts and ask them for that. That’s probably the best way. \r\n Q: Okay, I’ll do that. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Lynn Brannigan (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Hi. Good morning. We are a manufacturer and exporter of automotive lubricants, chemicals. And we have not attempted to export to the Indian market yet, but it’s on my radar for this year. So my question goes back to the B-I-N number. We use a freight forwarder for all of our shipments and then we don’t get into any of the import on the other side. So is this B-I-N number essential for us before we start exporting? \r\n MR. : No. If you are exporting it, it is not applicable to you. All those B-I-N numbers or I-E-C (ph) is applicable only to the importer in India. \r\n Q: Excellent. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Margaret Bruneld (ph). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes. Thank you. I have two questions. \r\n We are a manufacturer of telecommunications equipment. We would like to do a demonstration for a potential client in India. This would result in very, very substantial duties and taxes. We anticipate, based on the numbers that we’ve seen, it could be as much as a half a million dollars in duties and taxes. \r\n Since India does not accept the ATA Carnet, what are the opportunities for a duty-free temporary import into India? \r\n MR. : Yeah. As you referred, the ATA Carnet is the best way to import into India and that you will face no hassle with the Indian government to import it as an ATA Carnet, provided your consignee in India should have the supporting documents required by the notification, customs notification. If those documents are intact, it can be imported as an ATA Carnet without payment of any duties. This is one way. \r\n The other way around this without payment of duty is you can import it as a temporary import, pay the duty during – (inaudible) – customs during importation in India, then after completing all the exhibitions and displays, it can be re-exported. After re-exportation, whatever the duties paid can be taken as a drawback from the customs by the consignee in India. But it cannot be a hundred-percent refund. It may be on a (slide rate ?) based on the period of usage. \r\n Q: Understood. \r\n The second question we have is, we’ve recently run into several requests for chartered engineering certificates for used equipment coming into the country. We have some development happening in country. And we haven’t had this come up before. Is this something that’s always been a requirement but not often requested, or has there been a regulatory change? \r\n MR. ANAND: It is a mandated requirement for all the used equipment imported into India. There are two ways. One is the customs has listed the chartered engineers which have been nominated by the customs. These chartered engineers have branches all over the world. So during your exportation to India, you can use one of these chartered engineers who have been listed, so then to avoid one more examination in India. But the chartered engineer certification for a used equipment is a (mandate ?) for Indian import. \r\n Q: And if I send you an e-mail under separate cover, could you direct me to the list of pre-approved chartered engineers for the U.S.? \r\n MR. ANAND: Definitely. Definitely I can do that. \r\n Q: Okay. And this is Mr. Anand? \r\n MR. ANAND: Yes. \r\n Q: Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Did you want to follow? Okay. \r\n Q: Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Paul Lynch (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes. Thank you. My question is this. First of all, we are a manufacturer of medium-value capital goods on the order – typical order value $300,000 plus. Is there a way – on occasion we would be asked to handle an order all the way through FOB delivered to the job site. Is there a way to quickly and conveniently get a decent estimate of what our total duty, taxes, fees, et cetera would be for purposes of estimating what the cost would be to deliver to a job site in India? \r\n MR. ANAND: You can do an approximate estimation of your duties into India. Just send me across your e-mail ID and the contact areas. We can give you the link. And in fact, Indian customs is coming up with a user-friendly website where you just have to go there and put the STS (ph) classification and it will list out all the possible duties into India. \r\n Q: Okay. And who’s speaking, please? \r\n MR. ANAND: Vijay Anand from Expediters. \r\n Q: No, I’m sorry, your name, sir? \r\n MR. ANAND (?): (Off mike) – Expediters. \r\n Q: Oh, okay. Very good. I’ll send you an e-mail. \r\n One more quick question, if I may. In the event that there’s a problem with a product once it’s installed and we have to dispatch an engineer and/or replacement parts, what is the impact of that type of thing on duties and customs on parts that are replacing something that has failed on a job site? \r\n MR. : You’re talking about replacement parts or – \r\n Q: Yes, sir, under warranty service, a part that was originally shipped in, has failed and a replacement part must be sent or installed. Do we have to pay duty and everything else on that replacement part? \r\n MR. : It depends, actually. What happens now, whatever the replacement parts, warranty parts which is coming into India is being levied (a part ?) customs duty. \r\n Q: So in other words, the answer is basically yes, a duty must be paid on any replacement parts. \r\n MR. : Yeah. Yeah. \r\n Q: Okay. Okay, thank you very much. \r\n OPERATOR: The next question comes from Tina Savrinski (sp). You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes. Thank you. We’re a manufacturer of vibration data collectors, hardware and software. And we are doing business with a partner in India. They’re basically a distributor for us. And we are exporting our data collectors to them to utilize in service work. They collect the data and then they send that to us for analysis. So the data collectors are not for sale. They’re for their use only to collect the data and then get it back to us via e-mail or over the Internet. \r\n What kind of value should we assess on the data collectors? These are used pieces of equipment and they’re not reselling them. We’ve been using our COGS. Is that correct? \r\n MR. : I’m sorry, I don’t follow you. Can you please repeat it? \r\n Q: Sure. We basically have a distributor in India, a partner we’re working with. And what they are going to do is we send them our data collector to go out and collect data on machinery with various customers, and then they will, via the Internet, send that data to us for analysis. \r\n The problem we are having is what value to put on the data collectors when we export them. They’re used pieces of equipment, and they are not selling them. They’re just utilizing them. We own them. \r\n MR. : Now I understand. The valuation should always be your actual pricing. Actual pricing of the product has to be mentioned in your invoices for the export into India, because the customs have something called the transaction value rules, which is being required by the customs act, section (14/40 ?), transaction values. So customs always go by the actual price of the product. \r\n MR. : Even if you don’t put a price for these particular data collectors, the customs will have a value for these data collectors and they will calculate the duty accordingly. \r\n Q: Well, we’re putting a price, but we were putting our cost of goods sold, our COGS, because they’re not selling them and they’re used pieces of equipment. \r\n MR. : So after the usage, are these data collectors sent back? \r\n Q: We retain ownership, so they might have them for a year or even two years. They would only send them back to us for repair or if we terminated our relationship with them. But we retain ownership. \r\n MR. : No, you retain ownership, but do you get it back out of India or it remains here? \r\n Q: It would be remaining in India as long as we had a relationship with this company. \r\n MR. : Yeah. So it’s simple. I mean you have to declare a value for these data collectors. Whatever is the price of these data collectors has to be, you know, specified in the invoice. \r\n Q: Okay. And do we put anything in there – does it help the end user – because the company we’re working with is getting assessed high duties, evidently, and does it help to put that it’s not for resale? \r\n MR. : It is immaterial if it is for a resale or for your own consumption or for the creating activity in India. It is immaterial for customs. The valuation is – the customs will go for evaluation based on the actual price of the product. For example, whatever the same product, if you are selling it to a third party, the (named ?) price has to be mentioned for your (either ?) transactions and even for your own use in India. \r\n Q: Okay. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: I think that’s actually all the time we have. We’ve gone just two minutes over. And so if there are additional questions that we didn’t get a chance to answer, please feel free to contact any of the speakers that are listed on the screen. \r\n I’d like to thank all of our participants for being with us today. And for further information on exporting, I hope you will consult www.export.gov or call 1-800-USA-TRADE. And I’d also like to thank our speakers for being a resource to our U.S. exporters. I think we got a lot of good information out there today, and so we’re very appreciative. \r\n Thanks again to everyone for joining us. This is the end of the call. \r\n Q: Barbara, just a second. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Oh, sure. Okay, one more thing. \r\n MS. : Yeah, this is Malla (ph) from Chennai. I think Mr. Vijay Anand’s e-mail address listed on the screen is incorrect. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Okay. What is it? \r\n MS. : (Inaudible) – his correct e-mail address, and could you please forward to all of the participants, please? \r\n MS. LAPINI: Absolutely, Malla (ph). I’m sorry for that and I will do that immediately. Just send me the correct address and I’ll make sure that everybody gets that. \r\n MS. : Okay. Thank you. \r\n MS. LAPINI: Okay. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for participating. \r\n MR. : Thank you. \r\n (END) \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-14","title":"India Customs","update_date":"2013-05-14","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["India"],"keyword":["Customs"]},{"id":"491","content":" January 25, 2010 \r\n Central America is a growing market for United States exporters, and U.S. products are highly accepted in the region.

Daniel Crocker will give a brief overview of the Panamanian market. Thank you for joining us. \r\n DANIEL CROCKER: Hi. Jessica, thanks so much. And I hope everyone can hear me okay. I know you can’t respond. But I really want to thank Jessica Gordon, first of all, for giving us the opportunity to talk about this. I also want to thank my colleague, Michael McGee, for allowing me to go first. \r\n Panama is sort of in Central America, but it’s – but it’s handled a little bit separately, for reasons I think we’ll address during the presentation. But the more prosaic reason for me going first is that I have – that I have to leave a little bit early from the presentation. So I also want to – after the hour, I want to apologize and tell you to please contact me by e-mail should you have any follow-up questions regarding Panama as a market specifically. You can either pass those questions through Jessica, or send them directly to me at my e-mail. Thank you very much. \r\n I also want to put my remarks in context here, and that is to say that I’ve been in Panama – we move around these countries every three or four years or so, and I’ve only been in Panama three months. So I hope you’ll take – I hope you’ll take my remarks with a grain of salt. At the same time, I think there’s a certain advantage to being here so newly arrived. First of all, it reminds me of the fact that we generally in the Commercial Service are really dedicated to helping U.S. exporters, but we really rely heavily on the decades of experience that our locally employed staff bring to the table. These are folks with very, very strong contacts in the market. And I’m sure you’ll hear that comment echoed by all my colleagues throughout Latin – throughout Central America. These are the folks who really know the market, know the opportunities, and have over the decades helped U.S. companies do more business, sell more. And that, the bottom line, is what we’re all here for. \r\n It’s also – the recent arrival has also given me some – it’s just really sort of a new set of eyes with regards to looking at Panama as a set of opportunities for U.S. businesses. And I’ve worked at small-and medium-sized exporters before and it – and I’ve also worked in Brazil, Mexico, Dominican Republic. And so looking at Panama as a market relative to those markets really makes a couple of things stand out about Panama. And I’d like to address those in the course of this presentation. \r\n So the first thing that – to keep in mind with regards to Panama is to look at it on a map and understand its historical importance. The bottom line is it’s the same reason why you pay “X” amount of dollars for your house, and why you can sell it for “Y” amount of dollars: It’s all about location. It’s all about location. Ever since Panama was discovered by the Spaniards, it’s been seen as a way to move goods. It’s been seen as a way to move goods. And increasingly, as a layer on top of that, the – sort of a platform for services. It’s a very service-oriented economy. And really, in the early part of the 1500s, it was already a major trade route for the world, because goods were – silver commodities, for instance, were being brought up from the west coast of South America, brought through the Panama Canal, literally on mule – on foot, in some cases – across to the Atlantic, and then put on ships and sailed over to Western Europe. \r\n There have been some breaks in that. There have been some times when Panama slipped a little bit. But certainly, ever since the beginning of the 20th century, in the early 1900s, when the U.S. government, largely with a sort of a military approach, built the locks-based Panama Canal, Panama’s preeminence in world trade has been assured. I mean, it really is – it’s a critical cross point. And because of that, when you look at Panama, you can’t – there are two – there are two ways at least to look at Panama, and one is to look at it as a country and a market destination in isolation and say: Okay, here’s the – here’s the market here. But the other way to look at it is to understand its strategic importance and, because of that, certain market opportunities that allow it to punch way above its weight in terms of purchasing power, in terms of being a very attractive destination for certain types of services that you wouldn’t normally associate with a small Central American country. \r\n So while the population is 3-1/2 million, the GDP in purchasing-power parity terms about 40 billion (dollars), it’s very, very much a service-oriented culture and a very pragmatic, trading-oriented culture; so a very high level of services, high level of sophistication. And then on the flip side of that, Panama has never experienced a time period where it tried to build up its own national champions in manufacturing or agriculture. Because it’s been so pragmatic for so long, and by both occupying powers and by its own government over the last few decades has – ever since its independence, really, from Colombia, it has always seen itself as a pragmatic trading nation. And as a result, as a flip side of that, it means that almost anything that you make is something that Panama does not make. Whether it’s food products or “widgets,” auto parts, you name it, they don’t make it here. And that makes it a very attractive market, for those reasons, because there’s no local protection. \r\n So what are Panama’s advantages? Well, obviously, the Panama Canal defines these things, and then there are layers of advantages that are built on top of that. But first of all, it’s a – it’s essentially a logistics hub for the Americas, and the Panamanian government is very protective of that – calling itself quite frequently “the Singapore of the Americas.” It’s obviously based on the canal operations, but it’s also some interesting things like direct air routes. So the fact that Miami for decades was functioning as a regional air hub is slowly being supplanted. It’s losing some business, let’s say market share, even as the market grows, to Panama City as a logistics hub for transit. So you can get direct flights from Panama City to almost anywhere, and there’s a – there’s a very, very capable airline called Copa which uses Panama City as a regional hub, and that’s at the cost of Miami’s business. \r\n It’s a very – the economy is interesting in the sense that it’s dollarized. And when I say dollarized, I don’t mean they have one-to-one parity between their local currency, called the balboa, and the dollar. The dollar is used as the currency. There is no central bank. There is no central bank. And that vastly simplifies your business planning, whether you’re a small-to medium-sized company just looking at export and offering terms and worrying about currency exchange fluctuations, you don’t have to worry about that kind of stuff. It certainly – it means that there’s been macroeconomic stability in Panama the likes of which Latin America has hardly ever seen over its history. \r\n Latin America is characterized by periods of hyperinflation and poor mismanagement and even default on sovereign debt. That simply has not happened in Panama. Inflation has historically been in single digits. It’s been in single digits. They cannot print money to out-run their debt. And as a result, there – it’s a much more stable economy as a result. \r\n And on top of that, as a layer on top of that, there’s a very sophisticated banking sector, which historically enjoyed a slightly shady reputation as a result of a, quote-unquote, “offshore haven,” or a tax haven, but is increasingly recognized – all the major banks are here – as a sophisticated and bona fide banking sector. So there’s – there are gobs of financial and credit availability. Several banks here know customer bases very well and have Master Guarantee Agreements with Ex-Im Bank, which means in the end, if you want to work with a – with a bank to offer, let’s say, terms underwritten by export credit insurance with Ex-Im Bank, Panama is a very easy place to do that. You could work with local banks here. \r\n As I mentioned, a very stable economic environment, but also political environment. There’s not – the range of ideology I think stems from, again, centuries of very pragmatic approach to local and world politics. And with the exception of the Noriega regime in the late 1980s and Operation Just Cause by the American government in ‘89-’90, the political environment has been extremely stable. There have been multi-party elections, a strong presidential system, but in the end, a relatively – especially within the Latin American context, a relatively narrow range of ideologies. So when a new administration comes in and takes power, you don’t see a huge swing in ideology – you know, everything’s written off and everything’s nationalized, that kind of thing. That just doesn’t happen in Panama. And has not happened for decades, so there’s a long enough time period to kind of accept that as the status quo. \r\n A very strong affinity for U.S. goods and services – again, springing from that pragmatism; also, from the proximity to the United States. But then finally – which is – which is, I think, true across Central America especially, as opposed to South America. \r\n But finally, there’s that special historic relationship with the U.S., because of the fact that the U.S. government, for roughly a century, administered the Panama Canal. It built the Panama Canal; it employed tens of thousands of people; it brought sanitary water and sewage conditions and lighting, and eradicated malaria and yellow fever; and then by and large was seen as a stable force for good over the course of that century. And really, the U.S. government in full force did not give up the Panama Canal – control over the Panama Canal until 1999. So this is a very recent transition that we’ve seen in the last 10 years. But a very strong, lingering affinity for U.S. goods and services, and you’ll see that borne out in the imports and the franchises that are so widely available here. \r\n In part, in keeping with that, I would say, to a certain extent, a bilingual and well-educated workforce – every time I read this bullet plan, I think I should take it out, because we do – we do – Latin America in general has a problem with good, well-educated, bilingual technicians, engineers. This is – this is always a challenge for Latin America. \r\n But to a certain point, especially from the point of a U.S. exporter, you’re looking at things like distributors, agents and representatives, and there’s no problem with finding those folks. The multinationals who install themselves here and are looking to hire a thousand people to do a call-center operation, those multinationals have a problem, because they do run into an upper bounds in terms of the number of highly qualified bilingual Panamanian workers they can recruit, and they’re subject to pretty severe labor laws. But for folks, again, looking for representatives, agents, distributors – no problem in coming here. You talk to people in English. It’s no problem. And you can – you can find good reps and agents, and we can help you do that. \r\n And then finally – again, relative to Latin American terms – it’s a very safe environment. Panama City has a million and a half people. It’s one of the smaller Latin American capitals out there. It’s very safe. And I can say this: Even with a – with a slight increase in recent violence, it’s very, very safe, relative to the cities I’ve lived in in Mexico and Brazil and Dominican Republic. \r\n So the Panama Canal is sort of the underpinning. That’s the big anchor. You know, it’s like the Bloomingdale or the Macy’s or the Sears at any given mall, right? This is the big anchor on which so much is built for Panama. It’s Panama’s unique advantage. Panamanians often refer to it as their oil, which I think is a – is a term worth keeping in mind. \r\n The Panama Canal alone does a quarter of a billion dollars a year in procurement, much of that for U.S. goods and services. There’s an ongoing $5 billion Panama Canal expansion, which is to allow for the passage of post-Panamax ships and which will have some impact, especially in the southeast and Atlantic coast I think, with regards to trade flows. And we’re studying the strategic implications of that as we go. \r\n That’s a $5 billion, five-year project, and it’s going to roughly double the capacity of the Panama Canal; but most significantly, allow the largest ships that are being built – practically the largest ships that are being built for containers – to flow through the Panama Canal and use what’s called an all-water route to go to and from Asia to the East Coast and to the Gulf of Mexico. So that’s something we’re watching carefully. \r\n But the big deal about it is this, is that the Panama Canal Authority, which since 1999 has assumed control over the Panama Canal from the U.S. government, is an – a semi-autonomous division of the – of the Panamanian government. And for the last 10 years, it has served as a shining beacon of how to run a government enterprise well: cleanly and with very, very little corruption; with multiple layers of project management, program management, engineering expertise; open and transparent procurement, such as we’re used to in the United States. It really is an impressive operation, and they’ve proven themselves to be very, very capable in the last 10 years. It’s really an impressive operation. \r\n Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for government procurement in other parts of the Panamanian government. That’s something we work on. They’re embarked on some ambitious infrastructure plans. But with regards to the Panama Canal, it’s extremely impressive. \r\n One of the other interesting things that I didn’t know about three months ago before I came was the fact that at the – on the Atlantic side of the Panama Canal – so on the – sort of the north side – you imagine Panama running East-West generally. On the north side there’s something called the Colon Free Trade Zone. And believe it or not, it’s the second-largest free trade zone in the world. It’s been growing very, very rapidly, and it’s currently doing about $19 billion in trade. So that – even in accounting for the dip in 2009 in the world recession. \r\n What is amazing about this facility is – and we’re studying how we can take advantage of this for U.S. exporters, especially – especially – small-and medium-size ones – is the value added that – it’s already in the – it’s at the mouth of the Panama Canal to begin with, okay? So it’s already – it’s already right – it’s centered where there’s a lot of world trade flows. It can take Asian cargo. It’s primarily doing this with Asian cargo, but it certainly can do this with U.S. cargo. \r\n We’ve seen some penetration for U.S. companies. And it can take a container’s worth – you know, a shipping container’s worth of stuff, and break it down and display the goods in a retail style environment. And then buyers from all over Latin America can come to this free trade zone and actually look at the goods and say, “I’ll take some of this, and some of that, and some of the other.” And then the merchants who are displaying the goods will go and build carton quantities, right, of, let’s say, shirts and jewelry and cosmetics and perfume and electronics, and ship to those buyers in Ecuador, Colombia or Peru, or wherever. And this business has been booming. \r\n So you can see the value added there. They’ve essentially achieved critical mass within this hemisphere for a tax-free zone – because it’s not a taxable event in Panama – where the goods are broken down, displayed, and all the buyers come. So the buyers don’t have to go to Asia or to different points in the United States. \r\n From a U.S. exporter, we think this is a tremendous opportunity, because where you might have to otherwise look at the eventuality of having representatives or agents in every single one of the Latin American markets that you want to penetrate, what you might be able to do instead is come down to Panama and identify a couple of merchants who could represent your products in the canal – in the Colon Free Zone, and sell to those merchants directly, who would then do all the paperwork and the re-export to those Latin American countries. So whereas you would have had to have, let’s say, seven or eight different reps in different countries, you might just be working with one or two merchant relationships in the Colon Free Zone. \r\n As I mentioned, we’re helping companies, with matchmaking services there right now, to meet with merchants. We think it’s a tremendous opportunity. The U.S. penetration of this market right now is only about 9 percent. As I mentioned, the vast majority of it is Asian goods – electronics, for instance, moving in from the likes of Panasonic, Samsung, Aiwa – into this area, and then being broken down. But we see – we think there’s a tremendous opportunity, so we’re going to continue to explore it. And if that sounds interesting to you, by all means, contact Jessica or contact us directly. \r\n So what are Panama’s principal trading partners? Well, as I mentioned, the affinity for U.S. goods and services really jumps out here. Of Panama’s imports, we have a 30-percent market share – 30-percent market share. China’s way behind, at 9 percent or 10 percent. We’re exporting – the United States is exporting $5 billion to Panama every year. And other major trading partners – the usual suspects, right? And then, the bilateral relationship is quite interesting, because Panama exports to the United States only 380 million (dollars). \r\n And what that tells us is a couple of things. One is there’s a huge trade imbalance. But it’s not a sensitive issue. It’s about a 10-to-one – or over a 10-to-one trade imbalance, in the U.S.’s favor. But what it really tells you is it’s proof positive of the fact that we’re not – when we export goods and services to Panama – but especially goods – we’re not displacing. And so it’s seen in a very positive light, the U.S. exports to Panama. What it also means is the barriers to entry are relatively low. Customs is fast and clean, and the tariff rates are relatively low, and there aren’t significant non-tariff barriers to trade for U.S. exporters. \r\n What it means is that you’re – if you’re looking to Panama as a new market especially, there’s not a large barrier to entry, because a lot of your colleagues throughout the United States are already selling there. So that’s a good thing to know. And it’s certainly – over the decades, we’ve helped companies tremendously with these types of opportunities. \r\n So for best U.S. export prospects, I have this slide, but I do have to tell you, again, I would say the take-away is this: If you have something that’s not represented here among these best U.S. export prospects and you’re thinking about Panama as a potential market, please go ahead and contact us, because if you’re not selling auto parts, you don’t care about this slide necessarily, right? But the fact of the matter is, again, Panama is a competitive market for U.S. goods and services of every flavor, and Panama doesn’t make what you sell. (Chuckles.) It’s that simple. There’s very, very little manufacturing activity, very little processed-food activity here. So please do contact us, or through Jessica Gordon, if you have any questions about that. \r\n And then, I can’t end without mentioning very briefly – and this is a note of distinction, because I’m going to be handing this over to Michael McGee, who’s going to be able to tell you about all the advantages that the Central America Free Trade Agreement has for U.S. exporters to Central America. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you about those things, because we have a pending free trade agreement – a trade promotion agreement – between the United States and Panama. It has not been ratified by the U.S. Congress yet. It has not been ratified. It’s a bit of a sensitive subject politically. \r\n As I mentioned, with $5 billion of exports from the U.S. to Panama every year, it’s not necessarily slowing down trade, but we do think it will only help U.S. companies. And if the tariff is 10 percent and it drops to zero, well, you know, that makes your product 10 percent more competitive than your competitors from Europe or Asia, right? So it does matter to you. It does matter. It’s simply something that the administration, the U.S. administration, is working on currently, but perhaps in a year we’ll see come to fruition. \r\n So with that, I’d like to conclude. And again, I want to apologize. Here’s my contact information. If you have any questions, unfortunately, I won’t be available at the end of the presentation, but please, either through Jessica Gordon, whose contact information you already have, or this contact information that you see on the screen – please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me. If I don’t think there’s a market, if my team here doesn’t think there’s a market, we’ll just tell you. But if we do think there’s a market, we want to talk to you and we want to see if we can get you down here because, like the other Central American countries, you know, Panama’s not Indonesia. It’s easy to get to. So come on down, and let’s take a look at helping you sell more. Thank you. \r\n Thanks, Jessica. \r\n MS. GORDON: Thank you. \r\n At this time, we’ll have Mike McGee to share with us an overview of CAFTA. \r\n MICHAEL MCGEE: Okay. Glad to have you all on this call. \r\n You’re going to move me over to this – (inaudible) – presentation. \r\n I’ve been in Central America now for about – coming on two years and – I mean almost – coming up toward three years. And I’ve seen that – but I have a history going almost 30 years, when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Central America a long time ago. So it’s been an interesting time to come back to Central America, and watching things as they progress in the region. And we see a lot of the great effort that the countries have made change. \r\n I’m going to talk specifically right now, and then some of my colleagues are going to talk about the individual countries. But first, I want to talk to you a little bit about CAFTA as an agreement and a general overview of what it means and what is involved. There’s – I’m sure most of you have heard about CAFTA and remember when it actually was being discussed. And I’m going to try to see if I can help you to understand what is important about it and why you might want to give it some consideration as you’re moving forward with your relationships. \r\n CAFTA stands for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Actually, there is another part of this called the DR, because the Dominican Republic is part of this agreement. They came in sort of at the end of this. But I’m going to just focus right now on the Central American countries, and that’s Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. \r\n And if you look at these numbers here, you can see that that’s not a small market. It’s – if you take them all individually, they can be somewhat not necessarily impressive. But overall, when you’re talking about a population of – it’s closer to 40 million now, and the fact that it is one of the largest trading partners as a bloc in the – with the United States and the entire Western Hemisphere and, you know, among the highest around the world, you see it’s a good – it’s a very good – it’s something that you should give consideration to. \r\n I think also, and something that is – I want you to try and take home and remember, is that it is one of the most receptive markets to the – to U.S. goods and services. When you’re here you – and if you come here, you will notice that people talk about going on vacation and they can afford to travel outside of the region or outside of their country, they’re probably going to the United States. If they are looking and can afford to have their children study, they probably having their children studying in the United States. The movies, the music, so many things, television programs, they’re all connected – there’s a huge connection. And as many of you all know, there is a very large population of Central Americans living in the United States as immigrants. \r\n The agreement itself is a comprehensive reciprocal and I under – trade agreement, and I underline the word “reciprocal,” because I think that’s very important for you to remember. There was a lot of concern about the free trade agreement when it was being negotiated, and some opponents felt like that this was not a good thing. But because of historical trade policy of the United States, going all the way back to World War II, the Central Americans pretty well had free access to the U.S. markets, either by having no tariffs for their products or having extremely low. In some instances, there were some quotas, but that was because of things like sugar and coffee. \r\n But on the other hand, we had a very – a great deal of barriers to our products, and then we also had to compete with European and Asian – not as much, except in some areas. But with this agreement, we got full access, and largely, as you can see there, most of our products now come in duty-free. And that is a very good competitive advantage to our competitor markets from the Far East and from Europe – or for that matter, even other parts of Latin America. \r\n We – I think something that is also worthy of remembering is that the – the Central Americans went through the whole process of the free trade agreement negotiations with a lot of publicity, because it was controversial here – more here in Central America probably than it was in the United States. But it really stemmed – started a whole attitude change. A lot of people who had before made – produced something, or was involved in some maybe local manufacturing, they really got into the idea: Maybe I can make some products, something, and I can actually sell it in the United States. And we have actually seen industries that did not exist before, now are pretty thriving and are actually some of the strongest growing, and some of my colleagues may talk about this a bit later. \r\n But some of the products – for instance, what are generally called nostalgic products – you know, they really are reaching out to the Central American market or the Mexican, Latin immigrant market in the United States, with the kinds of foods and products that they miss because they’re far away from home. And this is a product that they can export. That market did not exist before the free trade agreement. \r\n Now, as you can see here, on an average, about 40 percent of their imports come from the United States. They, too, are very heavily dependent from the united – on the United States for much of what they consume here. Interestingly enough – and this may fit into your interests – but about 60 percent of what we export to these countries are capital equipment and raw materials; which means we’re helping them to be productive, because a lot of times, they may be selling something. So this trade relationship has been a very positive one for us. \r\n Again, the proximity and openness – there have been some advantages for U.S. companies or other companies from elsewhere to come in here and invest under the free trade agreement, because they can take their products and get them to the United States very quickly. There may be some cost advantages – or there were some from Asia, particularly China. But this – Central American markets are very quick to be able to respond to producing something and getting it back to the United States, whether it’s in the assembly process or it’s just straight-out manufacturing. \r\n There have been a lot of U.S. companies come into the region to work in the banking area and the retail area, power generation, power distribution. And those have been some – those have been very successful. And something else that I think is very important in this is that this has been a catalyst toward much more integration among Central Americans. And I’ll talk a bit more about that in a moment. \r\n I put this up here – these are the chapters of the free trade agreement. And you can see from those as you glance through them, there’s not really one that talks about tariff reduction. It’s really more about making sure that the rules for doing business are clear, that there’s some predictability, that there’s more access than anything else. When we talk about reducing the tariffs, that is an important element and it does give us a competitive advantage, but it does very little to get into a market if you – you can’t be very dependent if the rules and the contracts and the regulations are not – are going to be changing, or that there’s going to be something that you can’t predict ahead of time when you’re making a business decision. \r\n And so this has been a very, very important element as well; perhaps in many ways more important than the reduction of the tariffs and quotas that were around before. It has also made the Central Americans – has given them a lot better options in terms of selectivity, cost and quality for products that before they didn’t have. So it’s much more of a competitive environment now than it was before the agreement was put into place. \r\n For those of you who want and need, there is more information; there’s some connections there. And I’m sure through the organizers they can get you copies of this, so that you’re able to participate or get this information if you want to read up more on it. \r\n But I will stop at this point, and also say to you that I think it’s very important – the first step that you need to do is make sure that you – if you’re not already working with your USEAC, U.S. export assistance center, and know a trade specialist from those export assistance centers, that you get in touch with them now. They can help you to learn more about the products. \r\n Very much – they are very good at cutting time and distance between us here on the foreign side of the operations and you who are trying to make some kind of decisions, set some priorities and determine some strategies. They will use their own experience, but they’ll also help you to find information. So they can help you to navigate through some of this information, or contact us or other – the Department of Commerce or U.S. government agencies, to help you to make decisions or find information that’s important for you to know as you try to make some decisions about which countries that you want to get into. \r\n There are some external challenges. It is a – there are a lot of positive things, but there are some issues that do impact trying to do business in the Central American market. Some of these may be, I’d imagine pretty well, if you’ve paid much attention to international business, you will – none of this is very surprising. \r\n These are things that we in the embassy, particularly in other sections of the embassy, are trying to work on, making sure that they do not affect the trade and business environment in the country. And whenever they do, we have a response to trying to deal with them, whether it’s Mr. Chavez in Venezuela, or whether it’s a government that decides to come in as democratically elected and decides maybe they like the job so well they don’t really want to give it up, or whether we’re trying to deal with some of the natural disasters that go on within the region. And so these are areas that you need to take into account. We are happy to answer specifics on any one of our countries and try to make sure that you can take that into account when you’re calculating your risk. \r\n There are internal changes – challenges. We have made great progress. And I can tell you from, as I said in the beginning, many years – decades of experience working with this region, we have made tremendous advances. That does not mean that this is trying to do – like trying to do business in your neighboring state or in perhaps a European country or Canada. There are challenges here. They are – they’re probably not necessarily surprising. But we do have mechanisms, because of the CAFTA agreement, that we can call upon to resolve problems. \r\n And there is a – if you recall from the – one of the earlier slides, there is a – there’s a whole area about dispute management. And despite how difficult and how big the changes have been in the six countries that are in the free trade agreement with the United States, we have had almost no instance where these dispute mechanisms did not work at the early stages where we were able to come and bring out an issue or the companies have said, you know, hey, you can’t do that, that’s not fair, that’s not included in the agreement. \r\n In any event, we also have here an office which was opened up a little over a year ago called CAFTA Compliance Office, which is part of the Department of Commerce. And these people are monitoring specifically to see that all of the countries and all of our companies are being treated fairly and that we – that the countries are abiding by the terms of the agreement. \r\n And again, these are areas where you need to know us and you need to know your USEACs, so that if you’re running into an issue, we get into it earlier rather than later; perhaps even trying to discuss it before you come into the market, so that you can have a – be walking around with your eyes wide open. \r\n I’m going to give you just a bit of data here, just so that you – more not so much – necessarily the numbers, but more the trends. As you can see, there was a very positive trend for U.S. exports into the CAFTA region before the 2009 economic crisis. By and large – and I think if you look at the total numbers of this – we are still higher than we were when this agreement began, and that’s a very positive figure there that the agreement did have a very positive impact on our trade relationship, on our exports. \r\n If you look at our sales to them, in some instances there are – now you can see that with the exception of Costa Rica – and that has to do primarily – and I’ll let Bryan talk about it a bit later. I think it was one particular product line there, and he’ll talk to you about that in there. But also, the trade did not fall off that much. \r\n As a matter of fact, when you look at worldwide trade with the United States among our trading partners, if you look at Central America as a bloc, the trade fell less both ways between our – Central American countries and the United States than any other country in the world, with the exception of Ireland. And I think that has a lot to do with the strong relationship, itself. \r\n There’s a slide that – just to let you know we have different ways. We will pretty well try to work with you and your company’s strategy, either what you are accustomed to using as a strategy to get into markets, or trying to help you to come up with a strategy that fits for your company and fits with the Central American market, to be successful in getting into this market. Again, your USEAC is your first point of contact. And they are a very critical element within this, because they are the partner and the liaison between us overseas and you in the United States and in your company. \r\n This is to give you an idea about how we’re structured here. We have – up at the top there, we have a regional operation that’s based here in San Salvador. We also operate with two countries where we don’t have U.S. Department of Commerce staff. That’s in Nicaragua and Belize. But we do have a – we do manage the – their operations there. That’s run by the State Department. And we do oversee them administratively in providing – making sure that their – the products – the services that we offer in the Department of Commerce meet the same quality requirements in those two countries. \r\n We have – as I mentioned earlier, we have a compliance office that’s run here with two staff. And they stay on the road quite a bit, trying to make sure that our companies – when they do run into an issue, they are (resolved ?) quickly – (inaudible) – countries do try to make them change because there’s a new legislature, or a new government official decides that he doesn’t – he wants to implement some kind of policy or some kind of law. And we have to let them know that’s not possible under this free trade agreement; we have access and we have these rights here, too. \r\n And then at the bottom, you can see that we have four operations where there is Department of Commerce staff in each one of these countries who are standing by to work with you. \r\n Here’s my information. So we’re happy, again, to talk with you. If – the USEACs can also tell you very quickly – I’m happy to talk with you and answer any of your questions and route information. But very often, your USEAC trade specialist will know which particular individual in our country or our countries manages the industry sector that you – your company represents. And they are a very important element in that process, because they’re the local experts that are here day in and day out, year in and year out. When we officers rotate through, we have to get up to speed, and we rely on them. But they know their industries, and some of them have been working them for decades. They know all of the major players in the government, and they know all of the major distributors here who you want to be working for – have working for you. \r\n I will stop here and let them – we’ll go into the specifics of each one of the Central American countries now. Thank you. \r\n MS. GORDON: Thank you. \r\n Our next presentation will be on Honduras and Nicaragua. \r\n MR. MCGEE: All right, I’m going to go – going back here at – I’m going to cover these two countries, because we don’t have an officer at this point in time in these countries. And I’m just going to try to give you a bit of information, just to give you a bit of a – more flavor for the country, for these two countries. And again, I think a lot of it has to do with the specifics of your products and the specifics of your company’s approach to exporting, or your experience within the region. You may be selling, and you just want to know more. So we’re going to try to give you a bit of information, to give you a better flavor for these countries. \r\n We’ll talk first about Honduras. Honduras, as you can see from here, they have a new government. If you watched much of the news over the past year, they had an interruption of the – as we say here, the democratic process. But they now have a new administration that came into power in January, and is moving along very quickly to reestablishing normalized relationships and to trade across the region. \r\n One of the important things that you notice there is that 17 percent of their GDP comes from remittances. Remittances are monies that their family members send home from the – primarily from the United States, to support their families or – whether it’s immediate family or extended family, back to this. \r\n You can see that their exports – U.S. exports have increased dramatically since the beginning of the agreement, and that there also – another very notable quality about Honduras is that they have their own mega-port. It is – it’s the biggest port – there’s a large port also on – in Guatemala that’s not too often – (inaudible). But most of Central America – all of Salvador, much of Nicaragua and much of Costa Rica – receive their goods and export their goods through Honduras and through their port there. \r\n This will give you some idea of the goods that we would consider the best prospects, and when we talk about best prospects, those are the sectors that we think have the greatest potential for U.S. companies to be successful in getting those products into these countries. They’re pretty diverse, and they link in very much into things that relate to these countries. There’s a high level of crime. There’s a lot of gang activity – throughout Central America, but in Honduras in this case. Therefore, safety and security equipment are very important. \r\n Travel and tourism, we find, as I said earlier, that the Hondurans, if they can, will be traveling to the United States. And we’re trying to help them to reach into places that they’re not accustomed to going to like Miami, Los Angeles, or Houston and New Orleans – not that there’s anything wrong with those places, but we want them to find other places as well. \r\n Renewable energy – these countries do not have oil, they do not have gas. They’re completely dependent. They have some hydro, some thermal energy. So we find these are good ways for the countries – the companies – the countries to reduce their dependence on energy, and we are producing more and more of these kinds of technology. \r\n Automotive parts and equivalent service, you’ll find that most of the biggest source of vehicles are coming from the United States, mostly used vehicles. The fleets in these countries, and particularly here with Honduras, is a used vehicle from the United States and therefore – and they last longer and they keep these cars longer than we would perhaps in the United States, and so the after-market is a very important market. \r\n Food processing and packaging, as I said earlier, as well – this whole growth in the nostalgic market has driven the opportunity for us to sell food packaging and processing equipment to the Hondurans, because they don’t make any of that and they need to get it in order for them to create their own exports. \r\n I’ll switch over to Nicaragua. You can also get a bit of a picture from here. I think something you may again, if you hear news and if you follow the Central American or Latin American news – President Ortega really likes his relationship with Chavez, President Chavez from Venezuela. But he does not – he has not broken away; he has respected the terms of the CAFTA agreement. That has kept him on the side of free enterprise, which we think is very important. \r\n Even after – he was also a very strong friend of President Zelaya, who was in Honduras and was ousted. Even though there was a free election and widely respected elected in Honduras recently and – President Ortega and Nicaraguan government does not recognize that government. Nevertheless, since they have to depend on CAFTA for a lot of their exports and imports coming through there, they still trade with (them ?). And that’s a very important element, too. Trade has been a very stabilizing factor in there. Again, you can see there our exports have increased 45 percent since it came into effect. And there are – it’s got a very poor infrastructure, so that presents a lot of opportunities in itself. \r\n You’ll see again some similarities between the two countries that I’m talking about, and you’ll probably see some of these as we move along. Telecommunications equipment, computer equipment – technology, that’s something we compete with in all Central American countries. But these are the areas that we have worked with State Department that’s usually the best prospects for Nicaragua. \r\n And it has – as Dan had said earlier, you know, if you’ve got – if you’re not in one of these areas, that does not mean that your product has a – does not have a good potential for getting into these markets. But all I would say is that you need to talk with the USEAC specialist and talk with us at post, in the embassies, for us to help you to assess whether this is a market or a set of markets that you want to try to get into. \r\n And from there, I will close again, and be standing by for questions at the end. \r\n MS. GORDON: Thank you, Michael, for those presentations. \r\n At this time, we’ll have Bryan Smith, who is commercial counselor for Costa Rica, to give us an overview of the Costa Rican market. (Pause.) Bryan? \r\n BRYAN SMITH: Yes, thank you, Jessica. Thanks for setting this up. \r\n MS. GORDON: You’re welcome. \r\n MR. SMITH: And – (good, we’re loading ?). \r\n It’s a pleasure to be here. It’s great to have a chance to speak with you all about Costa Rica. For those of you from Mississippi, where my mother was born and raised, I’d just like to say: Hi, y’all. Don’t have much chance to do that. I’d also like to note that in this market there’s a serious lack of grits. So that’s an export opportunity for you. \r\n Let’s move on. Costa Rica, I would say, is a study in contrasts. It’s a world leader in a lot of things, and it falls far behind in others. It’s got beauty, pitfalls, challenges, frustration, opportunities – the whole package. In fact, the challenges are the opportunity, as they usually are. And we’re going to go into that a little bit. \r\n There tend to be a number of preconceptions about Costa Rica, some of which you might have heard and some of which are correct. I know for me, when I first heard I was going to be assigned here – I’ve been here for about a year and a half now – and I realized that they had shot “Jurassic Park” in Costa Rica, my main concern was the raptors. And I found out later that the really scary thing is the potholes. The potholes are so bad here that if the police catch you driving in a straight line, they arrest you for drunk driving. The potholes are just – they’re a part of the infrastructure, and infrastructure is one of those great areas here that offers, very seriously, challenges and opportunity. It’s been neglected for a long time – ports, road particularly – and now they’re ready to move forward on repairing and upgrading these, as we look to move Costa Rica into become a fully developed nation, according to President Arias, by 2021. \r\n I’m going to ask Jessica if you can perhaps move the cursor to the slide, the other slide here that we have on country highlights. Thank you. \r\n As a country, Costa Rica is fairly small. It’s less than half the size of Mississippi; it’s about the size of West Virginia. This 95-percent literacy rate means they can read and write, but the average person here doesn’t get past the eighth grade. Counterbalancing that is the fact that there are 10 universities in San Jose, the capital, and they’re quite good, and they’re accessible to the people in the population. \r\n Speak Spanish here, of course, in Costa Rica, but there’s a lot of English around, which is helpful for the increasing numbers of U.S. multinationals that are locating offices here. Essentially, they’re called back-office or financial operations, where they use not only the bilingual benefits that they – they’ll find here in the local market, but also the good, well-educated people. This may be a little bit different from Panama. Panama has some tremendous advantages in some areas. I think that the people in this country tend to be an advantage. The idea of multinationals coming here and doing back-office operations really is not related to what we do in promoting U.S. exports, but it is an attractive aspect for American business in general. \r\n Now, as for being a democratic republic, you know, Costa Rica is the only Latin American country that’s on the list of the world’s 22 older democracies, and that’s very important for (us ?) strategically. This is particularly the case when there are some antidemocratic players in the region. And Mike referred to this. These guys try to make mischief, spread their influence. And Costa Rica is a bulwark against that. It leads by example, and it is a wonderful example. \r\n Life expectancy, 76 years, means they live long and prosper – well, at least three-quarters of them do, because the poverty rate at over 18 percent is fairly significant, but then extreme poverty is another 4-1/2 percent. And it makes for a populace nearly a quarter of the entire population which is in somewhat dire straits. But life goes on. GDP is about $30 billion. It’s not so much, but per capita GDP is roughly double that of the next-closest Central American country. So there is disposable income here, and there’s an appreciation, again, as Mike mentioned, of the value and quality of U.S.-made products. This comes from knowing us for a long time and being in close association with the U.S. over the years. \r\n Also, with regard to the GDP, the growth has been whipsawed. In 2007, it was 8.8 percent. Tremendous. The following year, 2008, it went down to 2.6 percent. Then it plummeted to -1.3 percent last year. But then, they have the expectation that GDP growth is going to exceed 3 percent this year. So it really is an economy which is buffeted by the world economy to some extent. Inflation has also been pretty dramatic in its swings, because it was nearly 14 percent in 2008. And in 2009, last year, it dropped 10 percent; it was just 4 percent last year. And the expectation is it’ll stay in that same range this year. \r\n Costa Rica, although as I mentioned it is susceptible to some of the slings and arrows of the world economic forces, it did weather the global recession fairly well. And that is because there are laws here restricting what they can do and invest in, particularly complex financial instruments. Because the laws just don’t allow those things, they weren’t into the types of products that caused loss in other countries; and so therefore, they did not go down as far and they’re already on the upswing. November-December of last year saw an increase in growth in GDP. So it’s very interesting. \r\n Now, to the market and best prospects. The market in Costa Rica is also fairly small; has a total trade relationship with the United States of just over $10 billion. And that means we export about 5 billion (dollars) to them, and Costa Rica exports 4 (billion dollars) to $5 billion to the United States. We are Costa Rica’s biggest trading partner by far. We’re their biggest supplier of goods. About 40 percent of what they import is from the U.S. We are their biggest importer. We buy about 35 percent of their exports. We are their biggest investor. We invested somewhere between 3-1/2 (billion dollars) and $4 billion in this little country here. And we are their biggest source of tourist visits. \r\n You’ll notice at the bottom of this slide that travel and tourism to the United States is 160 travelers. Well, we have nearly 2 million a year from the United States coming down here. Fairly interesting thing, and that’s nice for the Costa Ricans, it’s nice for the people who come down. Our interest is in getting Costa Ricans to the United States. But the American travelers and the European travelers that find Costa Rica as a fascinating place from an ecological standpoint bring money with them. And the $1.3 billion a year that the Americans spend and the Asians and the Europeans spend is a driving factor for a lot of the U.S. exports that come here. \r\n I’ll call your attention to the third and fourth industries that are shown on best business prospects: construction equipment and building materials; 36 million (dollars) and $26 million last year, all of last year. That’s still a reasonably good shot for the future. It was dramatically higher until the economic situation worsened and – because much of the investment and much of the construction comes from the United States, and that which comes from Costa Rica and other investors, they still tend to buy most of their building materials from the States. That’s – what has happened has been a major downturn from 2008 to 2009, not unlike our own in the States; but with the upturn already beginning to take place, plus the public sector here, the government, building things to try to pick up the slack. And it has done so to some extent. \r\n Let me go to medical equipment and give you a little background on that. We see medical equipment leading the parade of opportunity here: $44 million imports from the States. This relates to exceptionally good medical care provided in a sort of socialized-medicine fashion here in Costa Rica. They have the social security system, which owns and operates over a hundred hospitals and clinics throughout this little country. And the Costa Ricans – or the “Ticos,” as they’re known – know their medical products. And even though they’re getting the government care, they typically demand top-of-the-line medical equipment, and tend to get it. The Caja, as it’s called, the social security entity here that runs the hospitals, buys about 85 percent of all the medical products that are imported into the country. \r\n Now, in addition to this, there are also some very fine private hospitals that are accredited by the U.S. Joint Hospital Commission. They operate on a first-world basis. Medical care tends to be a good deal cheaper than in the U.S., and this combination of quality and price has driven another dimension here called “medical tourism”: people coming from the U.S. and other places looking for cheaper, quality medical care. All the same, we’re trying to send Costa Ricans to the United States for specialized care. What this has done is closed the circle and driven the demand for U.S. medical equipment. So it’s a growing industry. Even though there are Americans coming here for medical care, the Costa Ricans are buying the medical instrumentation and such from the States. \r\n Auto parts. Well, this is similar to a lot of Latin American countries, where import duties tend to be high. Now, with CAFTA in place, the import duties have gone down significantly. Over 80 percent of all the products are coming in here duty-free now. Unlike the other countries, CAFTA got underway in Costa Rica about two-and-a-half years later. It’s only been in place for one year, and that year, unfortunately, happened to coincide with the downturn in the world economy. And so whatever the beneficial results are has been obscured by that other major happening. But it’s generally felt that having this free trade agreement in place in Costa Rica helped to dampen the blow, in addition to the other factors that I mentioned that helped them to survive the downturn. \r\n Automobile parts become a popular item when it’s extremely expensive to bring in new automobiles. And while we may not have duties on those automobiles, there may be excise taxes and other things that really drive the price up, so it makes more sense to repair your car, rather than to trade it in and buy another one. This has driven, as I said, throughout Latin America a strong demand for auto parts. This is definitely the case here in Costa Rica. Earlier this year, our specialist for the automotive industry recruited a delegation of 50 buyers from Costa Rica to go to the big AAIW auto-parts trade show in Las Vegas. And even in tough times, they’re out there looking for product. \r\n I would then like to take a look at the telecommunications equipment. In this situation, I think the number is going to go up fairly significantly. Telecommunications, and specifically cellular telephony, or cell phone – the ability to operate cell phone companies in country, was made available through CAFTA. And the same is true – that had been a monopoly situation – the same is true with another part of the telecom industry, which is the Internet. That has also been de-monopolized, in my word, as well as the insurance industry. So telecommunications equipment is currently being imported, but as these new, private-sector competitors to the government cell phone system take hold, I fully expect telecom equipment numbers to go up fairly substantially. \r\n Taking a look at food and packaging equipment, this relates also to the resort development, which was construction and building materials I was referring to, driven by investment in resorts and hotels in the northwest part of this country. And food and packaging – food processing and packaging equipment is all a part of that overall picture. And yet, there are quite a number of entities here that look to the United States to replace their existing equipments and they’re growing. So that is a phenomenon that I, too, believe, just as construction equipment and building materials, will have an upswing into higher numbers as we go along. \r\n Electronic security equipment is an unfortunate reflection of a more difficult security situation here in country. While it’s by no means terrible, it is something that has affected one family in four, and for that reason the people that can afford it are buying electronic security equipment for their homes and for their businesses. \r\n Okay. Now, I had mentioned challenges and opportunities. I’d like to give you a couple of ideas about this. Some of the challenges tend to be bureaucracy and red tape. The government monopolies have been a challenge, but some of the significant monopolies, as I just mentioned, are now coming into private hands, and so that will be better. \r\n IPR enforcement has not been terribly good. The judicial system is incredibly slow here. If you have a problem, it will take a long time to resolve that if you end up in the court system. Aging infrastructure, as I was mentioning, is a challenge. Well, that’s an opportunity. Just wanted to go into a couple of things here that are relating to infrastructure projects that are on the drawing boards. \r\n There are a pair of twinned ports, you might call them, on the Atlantic side of the country. One is the port of Limon, the other is Moin. They’re right next to each other; operated by the same entity. I believe they have been, unfortunately, at the top of the list when it comes to things that you don’t want to run into. The World Economic Forum places them, in terms of port infrastructure quality, 128th out of 133 countries. That is pretty bad. Well, efforts are being made right now to change that, and change it dramatically. \r\n The port of Moin is going to be an $812 million expansion to accommodate four more ships – it’s basically building a new port – 74 million (dollars) to enlarge and modernize the existing port. And then the port of Limon is going to be converted to a cruise port itself. And there’s going to be a petroleum dock that’s going to be built, another $80 million. Hydroelectric project – this is a country where it relies on more than 80 percent of its electric power from hydroelectric sources. They’re building another 630-megawatt hydroelectric project here. Plus, there is a water – waste-water project, at a quarter of a billion dollars, which really is providing – or will provide – a world-class waste-water treatment system for the San Jose metropolitan area. \r\n Now, the other thing before I finish with you, I just would like to mention quickly some of the unique aspects of this country, some of the top-of-the-world type situations. One is, Costa Rica is number one healthiest environment in the world. It is number one – that’s NASA gave that indication – number one most bio-intense place on Earth, according to National Geographic; number one in terms of U.S. Social Security checks sent; number one in stolen U.S. passports – the surfers come down and they – when they get back to shore, they have difficulty finding their stuff – number one biggest pineapple exporter in the world. \r\n It’s number five global environmental performance index, according to Forbes; number – fifth-best environmentally friendly country in the world; (fifth ?) cleanest country in the world, according to Yale and Columbia. But at the same time, the government of Costa Rica says that they only treat 3 percent of the sewage, and the rest of it’s dumped into the water – the oceans and the rivers. So there’s some – there’s continuities here. \r\n The World Health Organization says it’s one of the best places in the world to live. The U.N. says it’s one of the best places in the world for medical care. The Global Competitiveness Index has it number one in primary education, but worst in the world in some ways in infrastructure. Ease of doing business, according to World Bank, 121st out of 183. So really, it’s a fascinating, fairly complex place that has a great future, but is also a smallish market, which you can look to as – for its own unique demand, but also as a place from which to perhaps set up regional sales operations, as many companies have done, for Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\n So those are some of the highlights for doing business in Costa Rica. Hope I’ve given you a flavor that gives you a bit of salt and pepper and has whetted your appetite. And with that, I will now turn it back over to Jessica. Thank you. \r\n MS. GORDON: Thank you, Bryan. \r\n At this time, we’re going to have Jennifer Gothard, from U.S. Commercial Service, San Salvador, to give us an overview of the market in El Salvador. \r\n JENNIER GOTHARD: Thank you, Jessica. And thanks to you, everyone participating today. \r\n I just want to touch briefly on some of the highlights in El Salvador, in the market here, and opportunities available for your companies. El Salvador was the first country to actually implement the U.S. and Central America Free Trade Agreement, which I think is very significant because it shows the very strong support in the private sector and by the government for working with the U.S. and working with U.S. businesses. \r\n Additionally, El Salvador has not had its own currency for about 10 years, and has been using the dollar. This really facilitates trade and makes it easier for U.S. companies to do business here. You don’t have to worry about currency fluctuations. When you give a price quote in dollars, everyone’s very familiar with that. It definitely streamlines things here for doing business in El Salvador. \r\n Additionally, El Salvador has TACA Airlines, which is the airline – one of the major airline carriers here in Central America. And El Salvador serves as a hub for all of Central America, with daily flights to Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, as well as to major cities in the U.S. – California, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, Miami. There’s a lot of transportation options, and in three or four hours you can easily be here and start doing business. \r\n U.S. products in general have an excellent reputation here in the Salvadorian market. They’re viewed as having a high value, a high quality and a good value for the product. And consumers usually are willing to pay a little bit more for U.S. products because of the reputation for high quality. Sometimes you could be constrained if your product is of relatively high price, in terms of attracting new customers. But in general, U.S. companies do very well and their products do very well here. \r\n And also, I want to mention – Bryan just mentioned Costa Rica’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business report. El Salvador’s fairly high for Latin America. It’s rank 84 out of 183. And what the World Bank is looking at is cost and the time that’s required for doing business. So for example, in El Salvador the cost for importing a container worth of products is about $820, and this is the second lowest in all of Latin America. Additionally, in El Salvador it takes about 10 days to import a container; and the only country where this time is less in Latin America is Panama, where it takes about nine days. So there’s definitely issues, but it’s very receptive towards doing business with the U.S., and has tried to facilitate its business processes. \r\n Additionally, there’s really not a problem with standards, with product labeling. The U.S. standards serve as a reference point, as well as Mexican standards. There’s very few import restrictions, and we don’t have a lot of problems in that area. \r\n One particular item of note is remittances. Michael McGee mentioned this before, the money that Salvadorians living in the U.S. are sending back to El Salvador. There’s over 2 million Salvadorians living in the U.S., and remittances last year were 3.1 billion (dollars). That makes up about 20 percent of the Salvadorian economy, and exceeds all international assistance to El Salvador. It’s definitely an outstanding feature of the Salvadorian economy, and the country is very dependent on that. As a result, it just goes to show the strong ties that Salvadorians have to the U.S., and the strong influence U.S. culture has as Salvadorians living there come back and forth to visit their friends and family. U.S. consumer goods are – and brands are very widely available and very widely recognized here. \r\n That being said, there are some challenges here. Definitely, the courts and the regulatory bodies are a growing concern for doing business. The court system here is very slow, and even when its court rulings are issued, it can be very difficult to implement them. However, we do have a number of – the Commercial Service has a number of products and services to help you find and vet a reliable distributor, representative. And that can help you avoid having to go to the courts and use the court system. \r\n The other really big challenge El Salvador faces is the high level of violent crime. This affects individuals as well as companies. On average, it’s estimated that security and crime add an additional 10 percent to the cost of operating in El Salvador, for the needs of extra security equipment, extra guards. Companies have had to limit their operating hours. So that is a very big challenge for the country. It does offer some opportunities, if you are selling security equipment. I guess that’s one way to look at it. \r\n The economic relations with the U.S. are very strong. The U.S. is El Salvador’s main trade partner, and it’s the primary investor here in the country as well. U.S. exports enjoy the majority market share. They were 2.2 billion (dollars) in 2008. That was an increase from 2007. They declined a little bit last year because of the economic crisis; however, we enjoy about a 30-percent market share. And El Salvador exports almost 50 percent of its exports to the U.S. Salvadorian imports to the U.S. in 2008 were about 2.5 billion (dollars). \r\n So El Salvador is benefitting from the free trade agreement and selling a lot of products to the U.S., and these Salvadorian imports also offer advantages to U.S. exporters. As we’ll see here in our best prospects, one of the areas where there’s a lot of opportunity – talking about Salvadorian imports – is food processing and packaging. I’ll go through all of these, but just to skip down to that, I want to mention the fact that Salvadorian exporters are selling a lot of food products, particularly nostalgic food products, to the U.S., and they require food processing and packaging equipment. And U.S. firms really have a lot of opportunities in that area because Salvadorian exporters have to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirement, and so if they buy U.S. equipment they’re more likely to meet those requirements. So there’s a significant amount of opportunity in that area, although U.S. companies do face competition from Brazil, Argentina and Europe. \r\n Going to the top of the slide, automotive parts and services: As you’ve heard, definitely opportunities in all Central America. El Salvador doesn’t have any domestic production, so all of its vehicle parts and accessories are imported. Ninety percent of all used vehicles purchased in El Salvador come from the U.S. And because of poor road conditions here, you definitely need to maintain your car, and cars deteriorate a bit faster. So there’s lots of opportunities for vehicle parts and accessories as well. \r\n Also, from the dental equipment market: Very receptive to U.S. products. U.S. products have nearly a 30-percent market share in dental equipment. There’s no local production, and Salvadorian dentists tend to follow developments in techniques, technology, equipment, from the U.S., and frequently travel to the U.S. for some American conferences for training, as well as to purchase dental equipment. \r\n And lastly, as has been mentioned before, travel and tourism services: El Salvador is among the top 40 countries visiting the U.S. Historically, Salvadorian have traveled to the U.S. to visit family and relatives, for tourism, for business purposes. Last year, we participated in a bridal show here, and it was really amazing to see how many brides were interested in different travel options for honeymooning in the U.S. It was – we were a little bit overwhelmed with “bridezillas” looking for travel destinations. So there’s lots of opportunities for travel and tourism to the U.S. for Salvadorians. \r\n Besides top prospects – (inaudible) – since I know some of – there’s also opportunities in other areas, as well. As has been mentioned before, if you’re outside of these best prospects, your best option is to work with your U.S. export assistance center, who can discuss with you the opportunities for your products in our market, and work with our commercial specialists here on the ground for your particular industry sector, to help work with you and evaluate the market and opportunities for your firm. \r\n In addition, I did want to mention one upcoming opportunity we have is a U.S. product marketing exhibition that will take place in October of this year. The Salvadoran Association of Industries is organizing its sixth annual industrial congress, which is a local trade show here in El Salvador. And the Commercial Service will be having a booth, and will be having a display of U.S. products. And this is a good way for you to market your products here on the ground. There is a of $125. We offer to distribute your company brochures during the event, provide you with a list of companies that have visited our booth space. If we identify particular trade leads of interest to your company, we will send you that information as well, and post a brief description of your company on websites here at the Commercial Service Central America operations for two months. So that might be of interest to some of the participants today. And to take advantage of this opportunity, you can contact our office here, as well as your U.S. export assistance center, or contact information at the end. \r\n Lastly, I just thought I’d mention a few useful resources. I imagine these presentations will be sent out. We strongly recommend taking a look at our country commercial guide. Also, the American Chamber of Commerce of El Salvador is very active here. They have a lot of useful information and a link to our U.S. Embassy website as well. \r\n Lastly, here’s my contact information. I’d be glad to answer any of your questions and help – refer you to the appropriate commercial specialists in our office to meet your needs. Thank you very much. \r\n MS. GORDON: Thank you, Jennifer. \r\n At this time, we’ll have Patricia Wagner, senior commercial officer, U.S. Commercial Service, Guatemala City, Guatemala, to give us an overview of the market in Guatemala. \r\n PATRICIA WAGNER: Okay. And Jessica, how much time do I have at this point? \r\n MS. GORDON: We are running short, but we have – we have a few minutes. \r\n MS. WAGNER: Okay. So do you want the five-minute version or the 15-minute version? What do I have? \r\n MS. GORDON: Okay. Can you work with the – maybe the five-minute version? \r\n MS. WAGNER: Okay. Just to let you know, we are one of the largest economies in Central America. We’ve got about 14 million folks in Guatemala, 3 million in the capital city. Our GDP is about a third of the entire region’s GDP, so Guatemala is a very large place to think about in Central America. Even though when you saw the (overall ?) numbers you saw Costa Rica very large, we’re still – we’re still an excellent market for folks. \r\n Since the – our CAFTA came in in 2006, about 90 percent of products from the U.S. now enter duty-free. Guatemalans like U.S. products. Even though you see that we have a center-left administration, this administration is very focused on safety, security, education and health in the rural areas. So there are more and more opportunities in the rural areas that we’re starting to see come up. But not a – not a lot of big central projects, but just cleaning up the infrastructure, working on education and things like that. \r\n Our VAT here is about 12 percent. So that’s something to think – take into account, the value-added tax here. When people are doing any kind of work with the government on any kind of projects, we strongly advise folks to verify it – where the revenue streams are coming from because they do have some issues on tax collection. \r\n They only collected about 9.9 percent of GDP in 2009, when the regional projection is about 15 percent of GDP as far as tax collection. Our social conditions are a little bit of an issue here. We have a lot of the indigenous kids are malnourished. So there’s a big focus on health and education here. \r\n International companies base their operations here in Guatemala. We have quite a few companies such as Proctor \u0026amp; Gamble, Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive. Colgate-Palmolive has manufacturing facilities here, but we also have Nestle, Bayer, other folks with offices here. \r\n Walmart of Central America, which just was sold to Walmart of Mexico, but they’ve got investments throughout the region in about six different sort of supermarket-type areas here. So everything from the big hypermarkets to smaller grocery stores. \r\n We’ve seen imports – U.S. imports from Guatemala actually do pretty well. They raised, in – from 2007, 2008 about 14.4 percent. As you saw in the big slide that we had originally, they talked about the issue of you know, overall, the region’s seen a little bit of a decrease over the financial downturn with the economic problems throughout the world. \r\n But actually, we did a lot better than the world average. We did not see as big of losses as they saw throughout the world. There is a huge propensity for U.S. products here. They do buy a lot of U.S. products and they like U.S. products because they like our service mentality. Price is still very important here. \r\n We highly suggest, you know, people need to register their own trademarks here. Do not let local folks register your trademarks. And we suggest that pretty much worldwide. Contracts – we highly suggest making sure that people put in their contracts the possibility – (audio break) – arbitration. \r\n Let me get to the note I have on here about the Guatemala and the U.N. having a joint commission here is because there have been problems with corruption in the government so that they’re trying to actually go after some of the biggest offenders. \r\n You may have seen in the papers that the former President Portillo has actually been – the U.S. has actually asked for his extradition to the United States because some of the money that he took was sent through – laundered through U.S. banks. So the U.S. government is going after him for money-laundering. Why don’t you change to the next slide? Or can I change that or you change that? Okay, thank you. \r\n As you heard from all of the folks in Central America, auto parts is one of our largest areas. In 2009, we imported over $331 million of parts and accessories for the auto industry. They don’t do hardly any manufacturing in this country, maybe packaging for agricultural products or plastics or bottling for beer and food products and things like that. \r\n But really, almost everything has to be imported in that’s any kind of a good. So 35 percent of those automotive imports – automotive part imports came from the United States. We’ve had a very steady market share on that. \r\n We take a huge mission like – like I think Jennifer or Bryan was mentioning to AAIW every year, Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week and I highly suggest if you have folks that are interested in those kinds of products, that – and interested in international delegations, that they come to that show in the United States. \r\n They sell those parts to mechanic shops, services stations, refurbishers because one of the things they do a lot in Guatemala is they bring in damaged vehicles from auctions in the United States that you know, cars that have been damaged in an accident or something and then they repair them here and they keep them on average – owners keep cars here on average at least five to seven years. \r\n Forestry and woodworking machinery – you might think that’s a little weird, but there’s a huge furniture industry here. And so – and we’ve seen – we have also very good climates for wood, so we have a lot of microclimates for a lot of specialty woods. \r\n But they’re like – they want to do a lot more technology upgrades and capacity expansion. They import $21 million on woodworking machinery every year. We’ve worked very closely with some of the domestic offices, taking people (up to see ?) some of the furniture shows so they can see new techniques. \r\n Safety and security equipment – we do have one of the country’s – I think El Salvador might be a little higher than us with security issues. But we’re – we have a huge security industry here. There’s about 20,000 police in Guatemala, but there’s about 200,000 private security. So we – we see a lot of equipment possibilities here. We took some folks up to ISC this year. \r\n There was a really decent-sized delegation was interested in going up to look at security products. Everything from armoring vehicles to putting on plastics on windows to try to make the windows darker and things like that. We brought in over – about – in 2008, which the last year I’ve got figures for, we brought in about $129 million worth of these products. And 46 of that – 46 percent of that came from the United States. \r\n Travel and tourism – we, like Costa Rica, send a lot of people up to the United States. Guatemalans are very loyal travelers to the United States. No matter – even with the economic turnaround, the U.S. is their preferred place to go on vacation. \r\n We have over 70 direct flights a week to the United States from Guatemala and we have nonstop flights to Atlanta, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Dallas, Houston, L.A., Miami, New York, Orlando and D.C. And since these flights are so short, it makes it very attractive for Guatemalans to plan their vacations or business trips to locations they can get to so quickly. Some of those prospects we see in the United States for Guatemalan tourism is family attractions, hotel, shopping venues, entertainment shows, sporting events, cruise – cruise trips, et cetera, et cetera. \r\n You know, I can give you all the stats and stuff but I know we’re very limited on time and I want to make sure you guys have a chance to ask questions of all of my fellow folks. Our country commercial guide, as Jennifer said, has a lot of the really basic stats so I didn’t want to bore you with too many of those. \r\n But we – any industry that you’re interested in looking at to come into Guatemala, you know, we would love to talk to you, but we would prefer to do it through our folks like Jessica because they can work with you to manage the expectations and they also know when we’re in or we’re out because of missions and so forth. \r\n And that way, we can make sure they give you the best customer service that – that we possibly can in the world because we think Central America’s an excellent place for your folks and we’d like you to come down and take a look at our countries. \r\n MS. GORDON: Okay, thank you so much, Patricia. At this time, our program did run somewhat late today, so for those that would like to remain on the line, we now have time for a couple of questions. (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n MR. : So we either excited you or bored you. I’m not sure which – which one. (Chuckles.) \r\n OPERATOR: (Gives queuing instructions.) \r\n MS. GORDON: Okay, if there are no questions, please remember that this presentation was recorded and it will be available for all participants. I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. \r\n OPERATOR: We do have two questions. Do you want to take those at this time? \r\n MS. GORDON: Yes. \r\n OPERATOR: Susan Wilkinson (ph), your line is open. Please check your mute button; Susan, your line is open. \r\n Q: Jessica? \r\n MS. GORDON: Yes. \r\n Q: Hey, are the slides going to be available with some of the information? I made some notes, but there’s some – some of the data I’d love to have copies of. \r\n MS. GORDON: Yeah, sure. I can send you a copy of the presentation. \r\n Q: Okay, that’s great. Did you have anything, Marvin, you wanted to ask? Nope, that’s it. \r\n OPERATOR: I have one more question. Mary Ellicamatcha (ph), your line is open. You may ask your question. \r\n Q: Yes, hi. Do you have any resources that can give us specific information on the vitamin market in this region by country? Like specific distributors and then large pharmacy chains would be very helpful. And also, would we be able to receive a copy of the slideshow? \r\n MS. WAGNER: Oh, I guess this is Patricia. I guess I’ll take that. No, I don’t think there’s anything specifically talking about vitamins unless one of my other folks happens to have done something. Normally, something like that that’s very specific, we would do a customized market research for the company. \r\n And depending on how many questions or how much information you wanted, we could do you a quote. So if you’re looking for a regional approach for that, that’s something we’d probably have Maria Rivera and the crew in El Salvador coordinate through Jessica. \r\n Q: Okay. So I would be able to e-mail Jessica directly? \r\n MS. WAGNER: Yeah, start with her. She’s your – if she’s your specialist. And then she can contact Jessica. I’d suggest you start with Maria Rivera in the El Salvador office, who’s the senior specialist here. I don’t know who has vitamins or stuff for El Salvador, but she can reach out to the specialists that would cover those industry areas and we could put together, maybe, some sort of a customized regional market-research report for you and give you quotes on that. Or if we thought one of the markets was probably bigger than the other that you should start with, maybe we would give you a quote for one of those specific markets. \r\n Q: Perfect. \r\n MS. WAGNER: But that we’d start with the regional office. \r\n Q: Perfect. Thank you, Patricia. \r\n MS. GORDON: Thank you. Also, if you would e-mail me, I can also send you a copy of the presentations today. \r\n Q: Okay. And that would be Jessica, right? \r\n MS. GORDON: Yes, jessica.gordon@mail.doc.gov. \r\n Q: Perfect, Jessica. Thank you so much. \r\n MS. GORDON: You’re welcome. \r\n OPERATOR: AT this time, there’s no other questions. \r\n MS. GORDON: Okay, once again, I would like to thank everyone for attending the call today. It has been recorded. Thank you. \r\n OPERATOR: Today’s call has concluded. All parties may disconnect. \r\n (END) \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-05-14","title":"Exporting to Central America","update_date":"2013-05-14","evergreen":false,"content_type":["Webinar"],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["CAFTA-DR"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Costa Rica","El Salvador","Guatemala","Honduras","Panama"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"489","content":" “Colombia and Panama FTA’s in Latin America: Realities and Opportunities” will explain the realities and benefits of the U.S. free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.
