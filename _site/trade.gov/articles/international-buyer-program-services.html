<div class="content"> Trade Shows: Connecting to International Companies 
 The comparative advantage of the IBP versus other B2B matchmaking service offerings is it enables U.S. companies to meet a breadth of prospective buyers from around the world all in one domestic venue. Given this, there is significant demand from U.S. trade show organizers to participate in the IBP. Between 2010 and 2012, the percentage of repeat IBP applicants exceeded 60 percent, indicating strong customer satisfaction among our trade show organizer clients.
