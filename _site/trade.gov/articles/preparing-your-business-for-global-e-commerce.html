<div class="content"> Selling globally from your e-commerce site is more complex than domestic sales, but there are huge rewards for opening your site to the 95 percent of the worldâ€™s population that lives outside the United States. 
 The U.S. Commercial Service manual Preparing Your Business for Global E-Commerce provides the information you'll need to complete international sales and how to integrate that information into your business operations from the very beginning of the sales-and-fulfillment process. This manual draws on the experiences of businesses that are now exporting throughout the world; we've included their stories as case studies to help you export successfully. 
 Interview with the Author 
 Listen to an interview with Commercial Officer Ken Walsh, the author of the E-Commerce Guide. Walsh provides an overview of the guide, discusses common issues online retailers face when going global, and describes the opportunities available for retailers who want to sell internationally.
