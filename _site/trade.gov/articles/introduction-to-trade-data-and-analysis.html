<div class="content"> Trade data can help companies identify the best countries to target their exporting efforts. Companies can gauge the size of the market for their product as well as develop a price strategy to become competitive. 
 The official U.S. import and export statistics reflect government and non-government shipments of merchandise between foreign countries and the U.S. Customs Territory (i.e. the 50 states, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), U.S. Foreign Trade Zones, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, without regard to whether or not a commercial transaction is involved. 
 The first step to accessing export and import statistics is to classify the product with one of the following commodity classification codes: Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), Schedule B Number, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), or Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). Each of these classification systems allow assign 6-10 digit codes for specific items, which them allow agencies to collect and analyze data for each coded item. For help with any of the terms or concepts, take a look at Basics of Trade Data. 
 Two Ways to Access Trade Data 
 Trade Stats Express is a service provided by the International Trade Administration (ITA). "Get the latest annual and quarterly trade data with TradeStats Express.™ Retrieve, visualize, analyze, print and download your customized output." More on ITA trade products. 
 USA Trade Online is another trade data service provided by the US Census Bureau. It offers the most current export and import statistics and provides a wealth of detail such as the unit price (quantity/value) of specific products in foreign countries. More on Census Bureau trade products. 
 The main difference between these two trade data sites is the level of detail each provides in data. TradeStat Express is great for accessing broader information, while USA Trade Online provides a greater level of detailed trade data.
