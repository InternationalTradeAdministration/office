<div class="content"> Any U.S. organization that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or U.S. air carriers and ticket agents subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DoT) may participate in the Safe Harbor.  Organizations generally not subject to FTC jurisdiction include certain financial institutions, (such as banks, investment houses, credit unions, and savings &amp; loan institutions), telecommunication common carriers, labor associations, non-profit organizations, agricultural co-operatives, and meat processing facilities.  In addition, the FTC’s jurisdiction with regard to insurance activities is limited to certain circumstances.  If you are uncertain as to whether your organization falls under the jurisdiction of either the FTC or DoT, as certain exceptions to general ineligibility do exist, be sure to contact those agencies for more information. 
 Please note that the form used for self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework is identical to that used for self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework; nevertheless, an organization is not required to self-certify to one of the Safe Harbor Frameworks in order to self-certify to the other. Organizations should also note that when they select “Switzerland” as a country from which they receive personal data, they are self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. It is critically important that an organization read the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, 15 FAQs, and enforcement documents before submitting a self-certification form. 
 Please visit the US.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor page for more information about the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework.
