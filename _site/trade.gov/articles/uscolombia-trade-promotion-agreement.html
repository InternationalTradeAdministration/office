<time>January 4, 2013</time>
<div class="content"> The United States – Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) entered into force on May 15, 2012. On the day of implementation, over 80 percent of U.S. industrial goods exports to Colombia became duty-free including agricultural and construction equipment, building products, aircraft and parts, fertilizers, information technology equipment, medical and scientific equipment, and wood. Other benefits of the TPA include: 
  More than half of U.S. exports of agricultural commodities to Colombia became duty-free, including wheat, barley, soybeans, high-quality beef, bacon, and almost all fruit and vegetable products. 
 Stronger protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Colombia. 
 Increased access to Colombia's $180 billion services market for highly competitive American companies. 
  Use the FTA Tool to find tariff information on specific goods. This search engine was designed to display tariff rates and how they are eliminated under the TPA. It also provides mini reports by industry sector or products, indicating how they are treated under recently concluded TPAs. This tool also produces information on trade and tariff profiles on all U.S. TPAs.
