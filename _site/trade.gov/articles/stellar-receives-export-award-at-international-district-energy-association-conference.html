 At the 98th Annual Conference &amp; Trade Show on June 20th, Stellar was given the U.S. Department of Commerce's Export Achievement Award. The award was presented by Deputy Assistant Secretary Colleen Litkenhaus to Stellar's Senior Vice President Kurt Liebendorfer. 
 Stellar, a Florida-based international design, engineering, construction and mechanical services firm, which is a member of the International District Energy Association, was recognized for recent success in winning district cooling contracts in the Middle East, particularly the United Arab Emirates. 
 Stellar has been selected to provide cooling contracts valued at USD 150,000,000, and are expected to be completed during 2008. Their process, district energy, is an efficient, environmentally responsible method of heating and cooling buildings. District energy systems produce steam, hot water or chilled water at a central plant. The steam or water is then piped underground to individual buildings within a designated area for heating, cooling or use in industrial processes. 
 The Department of Commerce's U.S. Commercial Service and its offices in Saudi Arabia and the UAE was instrumental in Stellar's entry into the Middle East marketplace.
