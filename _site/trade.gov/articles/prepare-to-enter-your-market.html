  Tools &amp; Resources 
  Consider how you might have to adapt your products/services for the target market. Leverage Market Research to learn about the target market’s industry standards, consumer preferences, etc. 
 Familiarize yourself with the  Regulations and Licenses that may apply to your product(s). Most export transactions do not require specific approval in the form of licenses from the U.S. Government. Regulations regarding all exports must be followed. 
 
Understand Tariff and Import Fees. It is very important to consider the effects of tariffs, port handling fees and other miscellaneous customs charges when determining your product's final cost. 
 
Determine your Tariffs and Import Fees. These are duties (or taxes) applied to goods transported from one country to another, or on imported products. Tariffs raise the prices of imported goods, thus making them less competitive within the market of the importing country. Before you export to any country you need to determine what the tariff rate is on your product(s). 
 Think about Non-tariff Trade Barriers, which are laws or regulations that a country enacts to protect domestic industries against foreign competition. Such non-tariff barriers may include subsidies for domestic goods, import quotas, regulations on import quality, and other Foreign Standards and Certification Information. 
 Consider whether or not Intellectual Property Rights violations are a likely risk in your target market(s).
