<div class="content"> While the United States and Switzerland share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States takes a different approach to privacy from that taken by Switzerland. The United States uses a sectoral approach that relies on a mix of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation. Switzerland, however, relies on comprehensive legislation that requires, among other things, the creation of an independent government data protection agency, registration of databases with this agency, and in some instances prior approval before personal data processing may begin. As a result of these differences, the FADP could have significantly hampered the ability of U.S. organizations to engage in a range of trans-Atlantic transactions. 
 In order to bridge these differences and provide a streamlined and cost-effective means for U.S. organizations to satisfy the FADP’s “adequacy” requirement, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland developed a "safe harbor" framework. The U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was approved by Switzerland in 2009, is an important way for U.S. organizations to avoid experiencing interruptions in their business dealings with Switzerland or facing prosecution by Swiss authorities under Swiss privacy law. Self-certifying to the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework will ensure that Swiss organizations know that your organization provides "adequate" privacy protection, as defined by Swiss law. 
   
 Please note that the form used for self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework is identical to that used for self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework; nevertheless, an organization is not required to self-certify to one of the Safe Harbor Frameworks in order to self-certify to the other. Organizations should also note that when they select “Switzerland” as a country from which they receive personal data, they are self-certifying compliance with the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework. It is critically important that an organization read the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, 15 FAQs, and enforcement documents before submitting a self-certification form.
