 After consulting with the appropriate U.S. Government agencies, U.S. companies can at times engage in certain activities related to civil nuclear trade in foreign markets that do not require a license/authorization. 
 Such activities may include: holding meetings with government officials, potential customers and partners; and, participating in trade missions and other similar business development activities, as long as information shared is public and not business-proprietary.
