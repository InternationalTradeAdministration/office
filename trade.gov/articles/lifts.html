<div class="content"> PHASE 1: Does This Product Apply to Your Product 
 As a manufacturer, you need to secure copies of the Directives and judge whether they apply to your product. The European Commission does not publish a list of products to which their laws apply; they require the manufacturer to determine the applicability of directives to any given product. The Directive 95/16/EC, Lifts, applies to lifts permanently servicing a building or construction. This Directive also applies to all safety components used in lifts listed in Annex IV of this Directive, as defined by the Lifts Directive. 
 The term “lift” is defined in Chapter 1, Article 1, #2 of this Directive as “an appliance serving specific levels, having a car moving along guides which are rigid and inclined at an angle of more than 15 degrees to the horizontal and intended for the transport of: persons; persons and goods; goods alone if the car is accessible, that is to say, a person may enter it without difficulty, and fitted with controls situated inside the car or within reach of a person inside; or lifts moving along a fixed course even where they do not move along guides which are rigid shall fall within the scope of this Directive (for example, scissor lifts).” 
 Items that are excluded from the Directive are listed in Chapter 1, Article1, #3. The Directive does not apply to: 
 
  Cableways, including funicular railways, for the public or private transportation of persons 
 Lifts specially designed and constructed for military or police purposes 
 Mine winding gear 
 Theatre Elevators 
 Lifts fitted in means of transport 
 Lifts connected to machinery and intended exclusively for access to the workplace 
 Rack and pinion trains 
 Construction-site hoists intended for lifting persons or persons and goods
