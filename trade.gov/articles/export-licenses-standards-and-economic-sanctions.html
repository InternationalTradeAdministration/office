 Some exports require an Export License before you can ship your product. Some foreign countries have standards that you should be aware of. Lastly, there are some countries that you cannot sell to. Use this section as a primer to familiarize yourself with the licenses, standards, and legal considerations that may apply to your product(s). 
 Export Licenses 
 Learn when you need an Export License and from whom in order to ship your products from the United States. Export licenses are issued for individual transactions determined by the product, the country, the end-use and the end-user. 
 Foreign Standards and Certification Information 
 Many foreign countries have their own standards and import certification requirements on things like: product standards, certification requirements, electricity regulations, packaging and recycling laws and quality expectations. If you want to sell your product in foreign markets you should be aware of these Foreign Standards and Certification Requirements. 
 Economic Sanctions 
 Learn how the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) at the U.S. Department of Treasury enforces Economic Sanctions on specific countries based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, which are set forth by Congress. 
 Bribery, Extortion, and Facilitation 
 Bribery of foreign government officials is prohibited by the U.S. under the "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act." Increasingly, more countries have adopted the UN Convention Against Corruption which provides similar anti-bribery provisions. 
 Extortion and facilitation payments are not the same as bribery and are not covered by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the U.N. Convention Against Corruption.
