<time>January 4, 2013</time>
<div class="content"> There are NO special documentary requirements for Free Trade Agreement-qualified shipments. The documentary requirements for goods shipped under the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement are identical to requirements for goods shipped outside the Free Trade Agreement. 
 For imports to Jordan, every customs declaration must include the following documentation: 
  Maritime or air bill of lading 
 Commercial invoice indicating value, weight, freight and insurance charges etc. 
 Invoices should be notarized by the Jordanian embassy or consulate in the United States. Certification by the local chamber of commerce is sufficient in cases where a Jordanian consulate is not available. 
 A notarized certificate of origin issued by the relevant authority, usually a chamber of commerce, in the exporter's local area. 
 Value declaration form for shipments exceeding 2,000 Jordanian Dinars (approximately US $2,825).
