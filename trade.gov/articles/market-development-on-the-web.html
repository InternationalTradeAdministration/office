<div class="content"> As with brick and mortar enterprises, market development is an integral part of a firm's e-business presence on the Internet. Companies should consider and evaluate the advantages of advertising online as an extension and component of their corporate growth strategies and as part of their international marketing efforts. Advertising messages often appear on portals or other websites that draw viewers with content (news, information) and services (such as email, chat, forums, etc.). Companies may seek to advertise on search engines that attract high traffic volume (e.g., Yahoo!) or target a specialized demographic (e.g., ivillage ). Some portals sell favorable link positioning or advertising keyed to particular search terms in a user query (e.g., Overture). Companies may also consider using an advertising network that feeds ads to a network of sites, thereby enabling large marketing campaigns (e.g, Doubleclick). (Note that all the websites listed above have been internationalized or have local mirror sites.) 
 Direct E-mail 
 Direct e-mail may be a good way to promote web presence, depending on the market, product, or service. Direct e-mail is an inexpensive way to reach thousands of potential customers. However, several countries have legislation prohibiting or restricting unsolicited commercial email (see the International Telecommunication Union website at International Telecommunication Union for more information on international spam legislation), and certainly any email must not constitute fraud. The Direct Marketing Association suggests that any email marketing should have: 
  An honest subject line 
 No use of forged headers or deceptive technology 
 The identity of the sender, which includes a "physical" address 
 An opt-out that is easy to find and easy to use (Note: Some countries may specify an opt-in approach. To ensure compliance, research spam legislation for each country you are targeting. 
  Whether you're targeting domestic or international customers, before choosing direct email as a way to promote your web presence, companies should be aware of the potential for backlash against unsolicited e-mails by consumers who feel overwhelmed by the number of such emails received.
