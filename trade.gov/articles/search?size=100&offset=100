One of the most common scams in international business is based in Nigeria and operates throughout the world. While there are many legitimate Nigerian companies who are doing business in the United States and with American exporters, there is also, unfortunately, an organized crime ring that tries to take advantage of American companies and individuals. The following article gives specific details about these illegitimate business deals, how to help companies identify if they are the target of a scam, and where to report possible scams. \r\n Where Do These Scams Originate? \r\n Many of theses scams originate in the West African country of Nigeria. There is a large organized crime ring that is based in Nigeria with members operating in other African countries and around the globe, even in Europe and Canada. \r\n How Do These Scams Work? \r\n According to the U.S. Secret Service Financial Crimes Division, \"Nigerian nationals, purporting to be officials of their government or banking institutions, will fax, mail, or email letters to individuals and businesses in the United States and other countries. The correspondence will inform the recipient that a reputable foreign company or individual is needed for the deposit of an overpayment on a procurement contract. The letter will claim that the Nigerian government overpaid anywhere from $10 to $60 million U.S. dollars on these contracts.\"  This fraud is called \"4-1-9 fraud after the section of the Nigerian penal code that addresses fraud schemes\" according to the U.S. Secret Service Financial Crimes Division. \r\n Recently, scams have also taken the form of bogus sales contracts. An African firm or government official requesting a rather large export sale will contact the targeted individual or company. The sale will often ask for samples (e.g. cellular phones and equipment) to be sent in advance of the sales negotiation. \r\n Other schemes may involve a religious-based contribution, inheritance, an ex-dictator/relative of ex-dictator trying to get money out of the country before going to jail, and people purporting to want to invest in your company. All of these act as bait. The scammers then try to get the victim 100% convinced that they would get the payoff. It is at this time that the \"fees\" are demanded. \r\n How Do I Know These Correspondences Are Scams And Not Legitimate Business Deals? \r\n There is often a perception that no one would enter such an obviously suspicious relationship. However, many victims have been led to believe they can share in such windfall profits. Individuals are asked to provide funds to cover various fees and for personal identifiers such as Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and other similar data. The correspondence will usually ask the individual to pay a fee in order to transfer assets from a Nigerian bank account to another account. These scams are called Advanced Fee Fraud because of the demand for upfront fee payments. \r\n Can You Provide Examples Of These Correspondences? \r\n Below are three examples of different types of letters: \r\n  (Postmarked Johannesburg, South Africa) From an officer of an official oil development commission of the Nigerian government. The commission supposedly gets 10% of Nigeria's total annual oil revenue to use for development projects. The official states that he and his colleagues have \"carefully acquired\" USD $22 million by \"duplication of files and over-invoicing.\" He invites the addressee to recoup a handsome commission of 30% of the USD $22 million because to get the money out of Nigeria, he needs to send the money as an overdue contract payment to a foreign firm or person. All the potential foreign partner needs to do in this \"risk free process\" is send the name and address of the bank, account number and name of beneficiary to which the officer will send the money. He offers to meet the partner and invest money in the partner's country. \r\n (Postmarked Lagos, Nigeria) From an official of the Nigerian national petroleum corporation. Another oil scam, the official writes that he is a member of an ad hoc committee set up to review contracts led by corrupt earlier military governments. After paying legitimate contracts, the Committee discovered an excess USD $45.5 million that needs to be transferred to the foreign partner's bank account. Again, the partner gets a hefty 30% commission, with 10% more to be used for \"taxation and expenses.\" The official even offers to import goods from the foreign partner's firm with the Nigerians' 60% in order to establish a \"lasting business.\" Again, all that is needed for this \"safe and guaranteed\" transaction is bank account information. \r\n (Postmarked Kotuka, Ghana) From a government official. Having received the foreign partner's name from a \"reliable friend,\" The official reveals he is the son of deposed Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. He has USD $12.5 million from one of his father's diamond sales to invest in a profitable business venture in the partner's country (Nigeria is too risky due to the \"unstable political climate.\") The official is less generous than the oil executives, offering only a 15% commission, though 10% will be set aside for expenses. All the foreign partner need do is contact him. \r\n  Spotting Scams? \r\n Requests to send money, bank drafts, bank account numbers, or personal information are red flags. Also, the correspondence typically talks about the confidentiality of these deals, urging the addressee not to speak to anyone about the transaction. Some correspondences will be addressed to a \"Dear Sir\" while others may come addressed to a specific individual. Urgency of response is another typical sign. \r\n If you or your company has never done business in Africa before and/or do not know how the correspondents could have received your personal information, you should be suspicious. Most persons doing business in Africa are familiar with their industry and can trace new professional contacts to a specific source. \r\n What Is Being Done To Stop These Scams? \r\n The Secret Service Financial Crimes Division established \"Operation 4-1-9\" to target Nigerian Advanced Fee Fraud on an international basis. According to the U.S. Secret Service Financial Crime Division, \"the Agents on temporary assignment to the American Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, in conjunction with the Regional Security Office, supplied information in the form of investigative leads to the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian National Police. Officials of the FIIB and Secret Service have made a round of arrests in Lagos. Evidence seized included telephones and facsimile machines, government and Central Bank of Nigeria letterhead, international business directories, scam letters, and addressed envelopes, and files containing correspondence from victims throughout the world.\" \r\n What Should I Do If I Receive A Scam Letter? \r\n First, it is important that you do not correspond AT ALL with the persons named in the scam letters. Any contact with the perpetrators puts you at risk of being scammed. Do not reply to their letters, emails, or call them by telephone.

As a result, Motorola reported positive news in the 3G bidding process, with the company winning a $310 million contract. \r\n \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, ITA creates, expands, and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas through the Trade Agreements Compliance Program. \"We promote policy that develops a more favorable business climate for U.S. companies in global markets; we employ commercial diplomacy to resolve trade barriers; and we leverage our bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to ensure our trading partners live up to their commitments so that our businesses can compete on a level playing-field.\" - Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance, Michael C.

Through ITA's intervention, the companies also received long-awaited refunds of overpayments made as a result of Thai Customs' inappropriate valuation determinations. \r\n  Photo compliments of: Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, Inc. \r\n Why it Matters: Thailand's valuation procedures were improperly increasing the customs value for imports of distilled spirits, forcing companies to pay additional duties and taxes.  It was especially important for the United States to ensure that Thailand upheld its obligations under the World Trade Organization's Customs Valuation Agreement so that other American exports to Thailand would benefit from the transparency and predictability provided in the agreement. \r\n The Problem: Beginning in August 2006, Thai Customs began using an inappropriate methodology to determine the customs value of imports of alcoholic beverages. Under this new approach, the customs duties and taxes owed were inappropriately raised.  The United States persuaded Thailand to revise its procedures. However, two DISCUS member companies encountered difficulty getting refunds for the higher payments they had made based on the earlier, inappropriate, customs valuation determinations. \r\n The Solution: A team of ITA specialists and representatives from other USG agencies persuaded Thai Customs to follow the procedures prescribed by the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement, and in March 2008, Thailand resumed its acceptance of the declared invoice value for imports of alcoholic beverages. By October 2010, with continued assistance from ITA, the last two members of DISCUS received full refunds of the cash deposits and bank guarantees that they were force to pay based on the higher, inappropriate, customs valuation determinations.

Domes International, Inc. manufactures its bulbous structures out of molded fiberglass. Some look like igloos, others like marshmallows. Among the most attractive benefits of fiberglass domes is their low maintenance. Termite resistant and energy efficient, they also protect against dangerous weather conditions, including severe monsoons that cause horrific damage and loss of life in certain areas of the world. \r\n The Challenge \r\n When Domes International decided to expand internationally, it was already selling houses to the U.S. military for faraway bases on tropical islands. Domes’ Director of International Business Development and Marketing Steve Pope was assigned the job. He is also President of World Discoveries, Inc., an Export/Import and International Manufacturing/Marketing Consulting Company based in Memphis, TN, who is contracted with Domes for their Global Manufacturing Operations. \r\n  A Domes International Structure \r\n The Solution \r\n Pope contacted his local Export Assistance Centers in Memphis, Tennessee, and Jackson, Mississippi. After talking with trade specialists at the centers, Pope and his company decided to focus on India. The combined forces of the U.S. Commercial Service in Mumbai, Delhi, and the United States provided Pope with market research and help on doing business with the Indian government, including contacts within the government who might be interested in purchasing domes. They included officials from Gujarat state who needed to house thousands of homeless families. The state placed an order, and later the Indian military as well. \r\n Pope and his partners soon realized they needed a facility in India to assemble components shipped from the United States. Having a local facility is a “win–win,” Pope says, because the “jobs created help the local economy, while we benefit stateside by providing the higher-end components.” The Commercial Service then helped Domes International apply for a $1.2 million U.S. government–backed loan from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Then, when the first shipment of the fiberglass molds and machinery got hung up in customs, Commercial Service officials helped retrieve them and arranged for operating permits and inspection protocols. Additionally, the U.S. Commercial Service offices in Mumbai, New Delhi, and Ahmedabad, India helped in obtaining some necessary product registration certificates from the Indian Ministry of Commerce. \r\n These early experiences led to more sales as Domes International began to adapt the product to fit local needs. Domes can be used as offices, schools, military barracks, and warehouses. A religious group is interested in replacing more expensive marble temples with fiberglass domes. You never know what new opportunities might arise when you’re on the ground observing what people need. \r\n In another case, a government client for a school building pointed out that people in one part of their state considered round structures with a hole in them as kind of a temple of doom and gloom. “Local folks wouldn’t go near them. So we developed flat fiberglass panels and added ribs and steel struts for strength.” It became a more acceptable box, not a dome, Pope explains. \r\n “We couldn’t have done any of this without the U.S. Commercial Service,” says Pope, who also called on the organization to make inroads into Afghanistan, @#$%, Nigeria, and other countries in the Middle East and Africa. “Thanks to the Commercial Service, we have opened our factory in Ahmedabad and are selling houses, schoolrooms, and warehouses in the surrounding area.” \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n One lesson Pope has learned is to be flexible: “Our initial business plan was based on the then current oil prices (Domes’ raw materials are 70 percent petroleum based). We went [to India] expecting to sell lots of single-family homes, and by the time we finally opened our factory, oil prices had doubled, and hence our raw materials as well. We discovered the better market was local governments and the military. We had to go there, make this discovery, then adjust on the fly.” \r\n “There’s no doubt that Domes International is a better company as a result of our experience in India,” Pope says. “We are much more flexible and also innovative. The client wanted a less expensive structure, so we went back to our labs and came up with an insulation solution that met their needs. Now we use these discoveries to improve core products and to offer more variations. We are much more confident going into new situations—listening, adapting, and finding the best solution. That we’ve been able to transform through our experiences overseas in just a few years is amazing.” \r\n Action \r\n Is your company considering entering an emerging market? If so, here are some things you can do, according to Doug Barry of the U.S. Commercial Service and editor of A Basic Guide to Exporting from which this case study comes: \r\n \r\n  Conduct market research. Big emerging markets like India have a lot of potential for U.S. exporters. A good place to start your research of this market of more than 1 billion people is to visitwww.buyusa.gov/india/en. Operated by the Commercial Service India, the site includes current market research, information about trade shows, and updates about changing customs laws. The site also offers Featured U.S. Exporters, where U.S. businesses can present product information, including photos and company contact information. \r\n Visit the market. One way to find out if a market is right for your product is to visit it. Luckily, it’s easier today than ever to make the most out of your travel dollars. Consider the Commercial Service’s AsiaNow program. With it, you can attend a trade show in Singapore, meet with prospective buyers in Malaysia, and then fly north several hours to the booming Indian city of Bangalore for more buyer meetings and product demonstrations. The Commercial Service arranges everything, including hotels. Visit www.buyusa.gov/asianow. \r\n Promote your company in target markets. You might also want to advertise in Commercial News USA.

From humble beginnings and driven by her entrepreneurial spirit, Sobrino, known as LuLu to her friends and customers, began preparing tasty treats—and soon thereafter founded her own company, LuLu’s Dessert. \r\n \r\n Starting with snacks from her childhood, like jalapeno-flavored carrots and roasted peanuts, Sobrino soon graduated to making jiggly fruit-flavored taste treats known in Spanish as gelatina. Unlike Jell-O®, which then was only made in powdered form, Sobrino’s gelatin was ready to eat from the time a customer bought it—a concept that Jell-O® would not market for another 11 years. With gelatins such as Fruit Fantasia, Orange Blast, Creamy Vanilla with Cinnamon, and Sugar Free-De-Light, LuLu’s has something for everyone. With total sales of $10 million (2005), LuLu’s is pleasing the palates of customers in the United States and Mexico. \r\n The Challenge \r\n Sobrino began exporting to Mexico in 1992 and opened offices and a distribution center there, but despite her knowledge of the Mexican market, she faced great difficulty in selling her product because of her inexperience in the export process. She often had only vague information on potential distributors of her product and did not know how to ensure that they were qualified and legitimate. She also did not have the most updated market research reports on Mexico. After reading an article about Sobrino in a local newspaper, however, Tony Michalski, a trade specialist at the U.S. Commercial Service’s Export Assistance Center in Newport Beach, California, contacted her to see how he could help her realize her exporting goals. Michalski and Sobrino soon began their partnership. \r\n The Solution \r\n With the help of Michalski, who provided services such as export counseling and market research, Sobrino began to make progress. She was put in touch with organizations such as the California Trade and Commerce Agency and the U.S. Agricultural Trade Office. As a result, LuLu’s Dessert began to have greater success in foreign markets, especially Mexico. Today, the company competes with local food manufacturers in Mexico, having contracts at grocery chains like Wal-Mart and Oxxo and an exclusive distributorship in the Mexican state of Baja California. \r\n The success of LuLu’s Dessert in foreign markets has been boosted considerably by the assistance of the Western U.S. Agricultural Trade Association (WUSATA), which has provided money to LuLu’s Dessert and other companies for marketing outside of the United States. The funds gave Sobrino the opportunity to travel, to participate in trade shows, and to create brochures targeted to overseas markets while being reimbursed a large percentage by WUSATA. \r\n Today, Sobrino has far-reaching goals for LuLu’s Dessert. Currently, exporting accounts for two to three percent of the company’s total revenues, but with a greater production capacity, LuLu’s is on a course for explosive growth, especially internationally. Sobrino would like to expand her sales beyond Mexico and into other parts of Latin America. “We think that all the world deserves one of our treats,” says Sobrino. “The Commercial Service saved our company time and money, and I highly recommend their services for firms looking to increase their export sales.” \r\n Lesson Learned \r\n Sobrino says that the biggest lesson learned early on was not to try to do it alone when it comes to exporting. At the time Sobrino began exporting, she had no idea that government resources, like those of the Commercial Service and the Export–Import Bank, were available. “I spent 10 years trying to make international sales, and continued to run into all kinds of problems—especially buyers who wouldn’t pay or couldn’t afford letters of credit.” Sobrino says that one time she even went to Chile to try to collect a debt from a customer but had no luck. By using Commercial Service and Export-Import Bank services that provide background checks on potential partners and letters of credit to guarantee payment, she has much more confidence in doing business with foreign partners. \r\n Sobrino also says she could have benefited from the Commercial Service’s customized market research reports much earlier in her export endeavors. She advises that companies be diligent about trademark protection, because in one European country, LuLu’s trademark was stolen and used by another company. Sobrino also found that customers abroad often prefer sweeter desserts than do people in the United States. “When it comes to exporting, don’t do everything by yourself,” she says. “When I go out to speak, I give businesses a good lesson in exporting.” \r\n Action \r\n How can you get the assistance you need? \r\n \r\n  Use the resources of government agencies. For financing assistance, contact the Export–Import Bank, which can provide seller as well as buyer financing at very competitive rates. TheSmall Business Administration (SBA) provides a full range of export assistance to small businesses, particularly those new to exporting. Counseling is provided at no cost. \r\n Do your research. Good market research can help you determine which markets are right for your product. The Commercial Services offers market research reports authored by our specialists working in overseas posts. Once you find the right market, the Commercial Service can also help you find international buyers in that market with services such as the International Partner Search and the Gold Key Matching Service. \r\n  \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

Founded by dentists, the company got its start by creating a mouth rinse that eliminates bad breath without masking it with alcohol. The key active ingredient was the unique odor- eliminating “Oxygene,” which neutralizes volatile sulfur compounds that cause odors through a powerful oxidation process. Looking to cure Fido’s bad breath? Oxyfresh’s pet care products freshen breath while eliminating microorganisms that cause periodontal disease and can shorten a pet’s lifespan. Oxyfresh’s pet care products also include pet ear cleaner, deodorizer, shampoo, jerky, toothbrushes, gels/toothpaste, antioxidants and an all natural “Mellow Out” pet relaxant. \r\n The Challenge \r\n By 2008, Oxyfresh identified key trends in the Asian market, and quickly sought to take advantage of potential selling opportunities. “Pet stores were opening up everywhere,” says Steven Wood, CFO \u0026amp; Vice President. “The middle class was growing and families were having fewer children. Pets were becoming the new family member, and we saw the opportunity for our products to succeed there.” New to the Asian market, Oxyfresh sought guidance on how best to proceed into such a large and diverse region. \r\n Some of their primary challenges included finding the right partner and distribution channels. “We were looking for a long-term partner and not a quick export sale,” said Wood. “The right partner for Oxyfresh needed to be as passionate about the product as the company itself, and promote and educate consumers in the respective territories.” \r\n Wood says that with the right partner, he sees excellent opportunities to help improve the health and welfare of pets and educate the consumers on the risks of periodontal disease, also known as the ‘silent killer’ of pets. \r\n \r\n The Solution \r\n Oxyfresh contacted the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) Boise office, and was encouraged to participate in a trade mission with Governor Otter of Idaho to Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, and Taiwan. During the trip, Oxyfresh met with pre-screened potential partners arranged through the CS Gold Key program. The Result? Successful new distributorships and sales in Taiwan and Hong Kong. After returning to the United States, Oxyfresh continued to work with the CS Boise office, which led the company to secure its largest overseas pet product partner to date, a distributor in Hong Kong. The CS also helped Oxyfresh set up meetings with several key players in other Asian markets, resulting in a partnership with a pet product distributor in Singapore, and promising leads in Australia and Vietnam. \r\n Having found the right partners, Oxyfresh used CS trade counseling and market intelligence to map out its distribution and marketing strategy in Asia. Together, they determined which distribution channels would be most successful, depending on where customers typically bought its pet care products. In Taiwan, Oxyfresh first made its premium products available at veterinary offices before rolling them out to larger retailers and pet stores. The second part of their strategy involved distributing educational materials to veterinarians and customers explaining how Oxyfresh products could prevent periodontal disease. \r\n In June 2010, Wood joined Governor Otter again on a second trade mission to China. As a result of that mission, Wood expects to be shipping pet product orders to Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing. “Our participation in the two trade missions to Asia have been a great success, due in no small part to the efforts of the U.S. Commercial Service,” says Wood. “They helped us identify potential partners, do the legwork that enabled us to meet with decision makers and owners of several prominent companies for us to consider, and also provided us with translation assistance —all of which have saved us valuable time and resources.” \r\n The CS also helped Oxyfresh connect with the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which provided export funds for working capital and to cover the cost of travel for the two trade missions. Thanks to the funding provided by the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the revenue created from exporting, Oxyfresh was able to support new product development research and consider additional international markets. As a result of exporting, the company has added a full-time employee and expects to see even more job opportunities as it grows their export business. \r\n “For the last several years, our exports accounted for only three percent of our overall sales. As of June 2010, we’ve more than doubled this amount, with exports accounting for nearly seven percent of sales year-to- date, and we expect that to continue to increase in the upcoming months,” says Wood. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Wood advises other companies, “If you are thinking about exporting internationally, do it! Utilize low cost available resources that can produce a high return. The U.S. Commercial Service can provide you with many services ranging from locating partners to helping you translate between international candidates and help you with promotional efforts by displaying your products on your behalf at key regional trade show events. All of which are pennies on the dollar from an advertising and promotion perspective. And the returns can be substantial.” \r\n Learn about the culture where you want to do business. “To be successful in the Asian market, you have to understand that it’s a relationship-oriented culture and agreements take time,” says Wood. “For example, Asian partners stress friendship, fellowship, and then business.” Having made strong business partners in Asia, Oxyfresh is now working with multiple Chinese companies to create a distribution channel that will better market all of its products throughout China. \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Participate in trade missions. Oxyfresh’s trade missions to Asia allowed them to meet with and establish partners in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. \r\n Learn about the culture of your target market. Wood learned that personal relationships are important when doing business in Asia, and patience and persistence are needed as deals may take a considerable amount of time. \r\n Identify trends in new markets. Oxyfresh identified opportunities in the growing Asian pet care market, and together with the CS, planned an exporting strategy for the region. The CS can help your company identify new markets and stay abreast of various industry trends. \r\n Choose your international partners carefully. The CS provides background checks on potential partners, and uses extensive expertise and due diligence to identify reputable foreign buyers and partners. \r\n  ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Success Story: Oxyfresh of Idaho","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Consumer Goods \u0026 Home Furnishings"],"topic":["Trade Counseling"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"165","content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n With the Cincinnati Sub-Zero team present,  Congresswoman Jean Schmidt (R-OH) awards Steven Berke, President \u0026amp; CEO of Cincinnati  Sub-Zero, with the CS Export Achievement Certificate. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n On July 2, 2007, Congresswoman Jean Schmidt (R-OH) presented the U.S. Commercial Service’s Export Achievement Certificate to woman-owned manufacturer Cincinnati Sub-Zero (CSZ) for recent success in the China market.

Online exporters must have an effective customer service program to build and maintain a customer base, and should consider hours of operation, local hires, language differences, etc. Customer service should be integral to website design and overall business strategy. \r\n Resolving Complaints \r\n Disputes between buyers and sellers are inevitable, whether the transaction occurred on or offline. How customer complaints are resolved is important to building trust and confidence with an online exporter's clientele. For most companies involved in online cross-border e-commerce, the most practical way of dealing with disputes is alternative dispute resolution (ADR, also known as ODR or online dispute resolution). ADR mechanisms can be more flexible, creative, timely, and cost efficient than courts in finding solutions that satisfy both parties. There are a number of commercial websites and private service providers that maintain information on international ADR. U.S. Commercial Service officers in your target market can help you identify a country's ADR use. Companies may also choose to participate in a trustmark program (also known as a consumer confidence seal program) that includes ADR services. For example, the Global Trustmark Alliance (GTA) is a new membership organization created to encourage cross border e-commerce by fostering consumer trust, encouraging good online business practices, and discouraging the development of burdensome and disparate governmental regulation. \r\n Being Responsible \r\n In the online world, success and reliability are equal partners. Before using the Internet to export, companies should review their online practices and ensure that they are seamless with their offline business practices, that they are worthy of their customers' confidence, and that they conform to the relevant laws of the target market. Companies should pay particular attention to taxation, privacy, security, unsolicited commercial emails (UCE), advertising content and jurisdiction. Of course, companies should always deal in good faith. \r\n Taxation \r\n An online merchant selling to foreign customers should pay careful attention to the tax implications of those sales. In general, once a company crosses a certain threshold of activity in a foreign country, the company becomes subject to income tax in that foreign country. Additional information regarding taxes is available at E-Payments and Taxes. \r\n Privacy \r\n U.S. organizations that collect personally identifiable information online should display their privacy policies prominently, and offer data subjects (i.e. customers, employees, other business contacts) choices about how their personal information is used. Customers, for example, should have the opportunity to refuse having their personal information shared with others or used for promotional purposes. \r\n Many countries have privacy laws, and organizations should take care to comply or face prosecution. For example, the European Union prohibits the transfer of personal data to non-European Union nations that do not meet the European \"adequacy\" standard for privacy protection. The U.S. Department of Commerce, in consultation with the European Commission and the private sector, developed a \"safe harbor\" framework that provides U.S. organizations with a streamlined means to comply with the European Union requirements. Companies may self-certify to the safe harbor and find additional information regarding the safe harbor framework through the Safe Harbor Website. \r\n Security \r\n All websites that accept credit cards or debit cards for online payment must meet the PCI Data Security Standards (DSS). The PCI DSS are a set of requirements to provide cardholder account data security. They include requirements related to security management policies and procedures, network architecture, and software design. The PCI Security Council manages the PCI Standards and updates them as necessary. Information on how to meet these standards are available at PCI Security Standards Council. A guide on meeting these standards is also available at PCI Compliance Guide. \r\n Electronic Signatures \r\n In legal terms, an online sale is an enforceable contract, a valid and binding agreement. However, in some overseas markets, a contract is only enforceable if it is signed \"in writing.\" Such jurisdictions do not recognize electronic signatures and, in the event of a dispute, would not enforce an agreement made via email or through a website. While many countries have modified their laws to recognize electronic signatures, online exporters should check to be sure their target market accepts electronic signatures and, if so, if those countries impose restrictions on which signatures/technology are legally valid. More information on electronic signatures can be found at the Department of Commerce's Office of Information Technology and Electronic website. \r\n Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) \r\n UCE, also known as Unsolicited Bulk E-mail (UBE) or spam, is controversial. Many domestic and international jurisdictions have laws about UCE. Violations may result in penalties. In addition, many email service providers, such as AOL and Yahoo!, have rules of conduct that forbid use of their service for sending UCE. More guidance on UCE can be found at the Direct Marketing Association website. \r\n Advertising Content \r\n Most countries have laws about advertising content, which may be applied to websites, banner ads, and marketing e-mails sent from the U.S. Find additional information on online advertisering and marketing from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \r\n  Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road \r\n Dot Com Disclosures: Information About Online Advertising \r\n  Although the Commission's publications focus on domestic law, they contain important information about \"best practices\" in the online environment. The International Chamber of Commerce also has Guidelines on Marketing and Advertising using Electronic Media. \r\n Targeted Advertising \r\n Some countries have regulations governing how information about consumer behavior online can be gathered, how long it can be kept, and how it can be used for targeted advertising. The United States has taken a self-regulatory approach to targeted advertising. In February of 2009, the FTC published revised guidelines for Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising: Tracking, Targeting, and Technology. In response to the new FTC guidelines, a group of industry associations published Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. The Network Advertising Initiative also published an updated Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct for its members in 2008. \r\n In the European Union, targeted advertising is subject to the rules stipulated in the Directive on Data Protection. These rules state that personal information concerning an identifiable individual can only be processed with the individual’s consent or to fulfill a binding contract with the data subject. As noted in the privacy section above, the Directive also prohibits the transfer of personal data to non-European Union nations that do not meet the European \"adequacy\" standard for privacy protection. Information concerning how U.S. companies can receive personal data from the EU by participating in the Safe Harbor program is provided on the Safe Harbor website. \r\n Jurisdiction \r\n Online exporters must be aware that they are doing business in a foreign jurisdiction, which means the laws and regulations of the target market apply to the goods and services being sold. \r\n Good Faith \r\n Dealing in good faith is perhaps more important for online businesses than for brick-and-mortar businesses, because customers rely heavily on reputation. Moreover, it is illegal in most countries to behave otherwise!

The intangible nature of intellectual property and the worldwide inconsistency of standard practices create challenges for U.S. businesses wishing to protect their inventions, brands, and business methods in foreign markets. The three most common vehicles for protecting intellectual property are patents, trademarks, and copyrights. This article is intended to provide exporters with a brief overview of intellectual property rights and the methods being employed to protect those rights internationally. \r\n What Is Intellectual Property? \r\n The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) defines intellectual property (IP) as \"creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.\" More specifically, intellectual property refers to a broad collection of rights relating to such matters as works of authorship, which are protected under copyright law; inventions, which are protected under patent law; marks, which are protected by trademark law; as well as trade secrets, designs and other related rights. It is important to note that these forms of intellectual property are very different and the protection afforded under them serve different purposes. \r\n What Are Intellectual Property Rights And How Are They Protected Internationally? \r\n Intellectual property rights (IPRs) give the owners of ideas, inventions, and creative expression the right to exclude others from access to or use of their property for a certain period of time. International treaties and the laws of the various countries differ significantly in terms of the degree of protection and enforcement available. \r\n The United States provides a wide range of protection for intellectual property through the federal registration of trademarks and service marks; through federal patent protection and copyright protection; and, under state laws, through protection of trade secrets and marks. Federal protections extend only throughout the United States, its territories and possessions. U.S. IPR laws confer little or no protection in other countries. To secure full patent rights in another country, you must apply for a patent in that country. Visit WIPO to learn about the specific intellectual property laws and requirements of individual countries. \r\n Some advantages and minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property do exist under treaties or other international agreements. For example, copyright protection is automatic in all Berne and WTO countries without any formality (such as registration, copyright notice, etc.), and is extended on the basis of national treatment -- that is, a U.S. author suing in France under French copyright law is entitled to the same protection as a French author suing in France under French copyright law. The World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on  trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPs) upgraded standards of protection for a full range of IPR. The agreement also provides for the effective enforcement of those standards both internally and at the border. The TRIPs Agreement is the first multilateral intellectual property agreement that is enforceable between governments. The agreement has a strong dispute settlement mechanism to resolve disputes. \r\n The question of whether to pursue international protection for your IP is not always clear cut: for example, there may be cases when it is advisable to forego patent protection to safeguard trade secrets and sensitive information that may need to be published in the patent process. In any case, the first step in determining if IP protection is right for your company is to secure the services of specialized legal counsel. It is important to note that in addition to obtaining patent protection, you should also protect your trade secrets through appropriate confidentiality provisions in employment, licensing, marketing, financing, distribution, and joint venture agreements. \r\n How Do I Obtain Patent, Trademark, Or Copyright Protection In Another Country? \r\n Patents: A patent is a legal instrument that gives its owner certain exclusive rights for an invention. Most patents are directed to a product or process that provides a new or improved way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. In the United States, the life span of a patent depends on many factors, but once secured, a patent generally provides protection to its owner for a period of 20 years from the date the patent application was filed. Since a patent granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) only protects the owner of the patent in the United States, it may be necessary to obtain patent protection from foreign patent offices for any commercial activity to be conducted outside the United States. \r\n The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) streamlines the process for U.S. inventors and businesses wishing to obtain patent protection in other countries. By filing one international patent application with the USPTO, U.S. applicants can concurrently seek protection in up to 115 countries. For an invention made in the United States, U.S. law prohibits filing abroad without a foreign filing license from the USPTO, unless six months have elapsed since filing a U.S. application. For more on the benefits of filing for an international patent under the PCT, read \"The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and it's Advantages.\" \r\n For more information on filing for a patent in the United States visit the USPTO website. \r\n Trademarks: A trademark is a word, name, symbol, or device that identifies and distinguishes the source of goods used in trade. In short, a trademark is a brand name. Service marks perform the same function for businesses dealing in services rather than goods. \r\n In the United States, rights to trademarks, service marks, and other marks are acquired through use, registration, or prior foreign registration. However, in most countries, trademark rights are acquired only through registration, and many countries require local use of the registered mark to maintain the registration. Whether a given mark can be registered in a particular country will depend on the law of that country. For example, some countries do not protect service marks. The United States is not a member of any agreement under which a single filing will provide international protection. \r\n To learn more about trademarks, visit the United States Patent and Trademark Office. You can also file a trademark application electronically using the USPTO's Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS). \r\n Copyrights: A copyright protects original works of authorship. In the United States, this protection gives the owner the exclusive right to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, or perform or display the work publicly. \r\n No \"international copyright\" provides universal protection for your work throughout the world. However, securing copyright protection has been greatly simplified under international copyright treaties and conventions, such as the Berne Convention and the WTO TRIPS Agreement. In most countries, including the United States, registration is typically not required. A small number of countries, however, offer little or no protection for the works of foreign nationals. Ultimately, copyright protection depends on national law. Before publishing a work anywhere, it is advisable to investigate the scope of protection available, as well as the specific legal requirements for copyright protection in countries in which protection is desired. \r\n Visit the U.S. Copyright Office, to learn more about copyrights. \r\n How Are Intellectual Property Rights Enforced Abroad? \r\n The ease of IPR enforcement depends on local law, the resources of the intellectual property owner, the attitude of local officials, and many other factors. In the United States and many countries, intellectual property owners pursue infringement claims through civil litigation. Internationally, avenues to address IP infringement vary by country, and will be dictated by local law. As required by the TRIPs Agreement, criminal procedures and penalties in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy must also be available in WTO member countries. It is important to seek proper legal advice on any issues related to IPR enforcement. For more information on enforcement and dispute resolution visit WIPO's Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) section. \r\n Transatlantic IPR Resource Portal \r\n The U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission's Directorate General (DG) for Enterprise and Industry have developed the Transatlantic IPR Resource Portal to make it easier for transatlantic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to find and use the resources that both governments have developed to protect and enforce intellectual property rights. The portal was developed by the Market Access and Compliance (MAC) unit of Commerce's International Trade Administration in collaboration with DG Enterprise's Competitiveness Policy unit. \r\n Report IPR Infringement \r\n You can report suspicions concerning the manufacture or sale of counterfeit or pirated goods to the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center. The IPR Center is a task force that uses the expertise of its member agencies to share information, develop initiatives, and conduct investigations related to intellectual property theft. To report theft of intellectual property to federal law enforcement contact the IPR Center Hotline (1-866-IPR-2060 or 1-866-477-2060) or via email atIPRCenter@dhs.gov. \r\n Report Barriers to Protecting Your IPR Abroad \r\n If you feel your company's intellectual property rights have been, or may be adversely affected by foreign intellectual property protection and enforcement practices, you may file a complaint electronically with the Office of Intellectual Property Rights within the International Trade Administration.

Leveraging the U.S. -- Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA), ITA pressed the Chilean government to reconsider EUR's eligibility to compete for this project, and opened the door for future government contracts. \r\n Why it Matters: If ITA had not ensured compliance with the U.S. -- Chile FTA, EUR and other U.S. engineering companies may have continued to experience discriminatory treatment when competing for other Chilean government procurements of public works projects. EUR Consulting was deemed ineligible to compete for a contract worth $400,000, and the case had implications for U.S. companies competing for future Chilean public works projects.  In the aftermath of Chile's 2010 devastating earthquake, the country is in the process of building and rebuilding public structures including hospitals, schools and other civic institutions. The government procurement provisions of the FTA provide that U.S. engineering and architecture design firms should have the opportunity to compete for such covered public works projects. \r\n \r\n Seismic shock isolators Photo Courtesy of EUR Consulting and Development \r\n The Problem: In February 2011, EUR reported to ITA that Chile's Ministry of Health excluded it from bidding on a government procurement opportunity to build a hospital because it did not have prior experience in Chile designing seismic shock resilient structures. The U.S. -- Chile FTA ensures that U.S. companies are treated the same as Chilean companies when competing for covered government procurement contracts regardless of whether the U.S. company has in-country experience. EUR Consulting has prior experience designing buildings throughout the world that can withstand seismic activity and, in accordance with the FTA, that experience should have been considered when competing for this project. \r\n The Solution: Advocating on behalf of EUR, ITA officials raised our concerns to the Chilean government and pressed the importance of upholding the government procurement provisions of the U.S.-Chile FTA.  In May of 2012, Chile’s government accountability office, which oversees Chile’s bid protest process, found fault with the Ministry of Health’s decision not to consider EUR’s global experience when assessing EUR's eligibility to participate in the procurement, setting a positive precedent for U.S. companies seeking to do business in Chile. \r\n \"Not too many people understand the benefits that free-trade agreements provide to US Corporations while doing business abroad -- having the US Government and the Department of Commerce's ITA on your side truly helps to level the field,\" said Eloy Retamal, President of EUR Consulting and Development, Inc. \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, ITA creates, expands, and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas through the Trade Agreements Compliance Program. \"We promote policy that develops a more favorable business climate for U.S. companies in global markets; we employ commercial diplomacy to resolve trade barriers; and we leverage our bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to ensure our trading partners live up to their commitments so that our businesses can compete on a level-playing field.\" - Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance, Michael C.

As a result, The Vinyl Institute located in Alexandria, Virginia, which represents PVC manufacturers, estimates that $137 million of U.S. exports to the EU were preserved. \r\n Why it Matters: PVC is commonly used as a flame retardant and insulation in electrical wires, power cords, and control devices. PVC is also crucial in making washing machines. U.S. industry was concerned that an EU restriction on PVC would have forced them to replace PVC in their manufacturing process, not only in the EU but worldwide. The costs to do so would have been prohibitive. \r\n The Problem: In 2010, the European Parliament proposed adding PVC to a list of banned substances as part of its revisions to the EU RoHS Directive. Banning PVC would have led to a prohibition of PVC in products such as washing machines, electrical wires, power cords and control devices. \r\n The Solution: ITA brought together representatives from U.S. industry, trade associations and government to avert this costly EU proposal. Representatives from the U.S. Mission to the EU worked with their counterparts at the Commission and the European Parliament to ensure U.S. industry's perspective was fully considered. In Washington, senior ITA officials engaged commercial officials at key EU embassies. ITA worked with the State Department to share industry views with key environmental officials in various European Union Member State governments. As a result of this coordinated, cooperative, government-wide effort, the EU decided against adding PVC to the list of substances under review, saving an estimated $137-million in U.S. exports to Europe. \r\n Wayne Morris, Vice President of Division Services of the Association of Home Appliances (AHAM) noted, \"The Commerce Department was uniquely positioned to assist the business community by bringing together the U.S. Mission to the EU, USTR, and several key offices at Commerce headquarters to rapidly react to this ill-conceived proposed regulation.\" \r\n Allen Blakey, Vice President, Industry and Government Affairs at the Vinyl Institute added, \"The companies whose manufacturing jobs were protected are grateful for the Department's good work.\" \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas.

The deal between Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. (CCTI) of Coral Springs, Fla., and Shanxi POAR Environmental in China represents some of the most advanced clean coal technology in the world to be sold to China. The agreement was signed in Washington, D.C., on Friday, Oct. 19. \r\n “President Bush is committed to supporting U.S. companies with some of the most innovative and cutting-edge U.S. technologies to protect the environment,” said Hernandez. “This agreement is a win-win for trade and the environment which can be vital to creating a better quality of life around the world for all people.” \r\n The agreement, estimated at $100 million for the first coal plant, is expected to lead to additional sales of this clean coal technology as China works to improve environmental conditions in preparation for the Olympics and beyond. Over the next five years, China expects to add nearly 200 coal plants, fueling billions of dollars in demand for clean coal technologies. \r\n The U.S. Commercial Service offices in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. and China helped Clean Coal Technologies to develop its relationship with Shanxi POAR Environmental. Through these efforts, CCTI participated in a series of ongoing meetings arranged with key decision-makers in China, developed an understanding of intellectual property protection issues, and built on a relationship that proved to be a key step towards securing the deal. \r\n “China was our top priority because of its high energy needs and demand for clean coal technology, and the Commercial Service was instrumental in bringing this to fruition,” said CCTI President Larry Hunt. “We expect this deal to be only the beginning of a growing relationship that will boost our economies and create new jobs in the United States and China.” \r\n CCTI’s patented technology removes up to 90 percent of the more than 300 contaminating compounds from the coal prior to burning, including carbon monoxide, methane and ethanol. The combination of heat and different atmospheric pressures removes pollutants in six to 18 minutes, a much faster turnaround time than the 13 hours required by heat alone. The first plant in Shanxi Province, China, is expected to be outfitted by late 2008. \r\n   \r\n Hunt also sees excellent opportunities in 14 “second tier” cities identified by the U.S. Commercial Service. These cities, though comprising only 8 percent of China’s total population, account for over 19 percent of China’s GDP and over 50 percent of China’s total imports—and represent robust opportunities for U.S. businesses. \r\n This agreement highlights the Commercial Service’s contribution to promote clean energy under the Asia Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate (APP). APP was created in 2006 by six Asia Pacific countries, including the U.S. and China, to work together to promote clean energy among its members. In addition to clean coal, APP also targets coal mining, clean power generation, fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, and manufacturing of aluminum, steel, and cement. \r\n With its network of offices across the United States and in more than 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration utilizes its global presence and international marketing expertise to help U.S. companies sell their products and services worldwide.

Fortunately, millions of people are finding an affordable and meaningful alternative to assisted living. Home Instead Senior Care Senior Care, a franchise service company based in Omaha, Nebraska, is a worldwide leader of non-medical care for senior citizens choosing to remain at home, but who require personal care, companionship, meal preparation, light housekeeping, medicine reminders, and help with errands and shopping. \r\n  Home Instead Senior Care \r\n Established in 1994, the company expanded to nearly 100 domestic franchise offices in just three years, making it one of the fastest growing franchise companies in the United States. Having found success in the domestic market, the company began receiving inquiries about taking its franchise concept international—a concept that aims to enhance the quality of life for older adults through the recruitment of highly motivated caregivers. \r\n International Drive \r\n With a career in the United States and her family in Japan, Yoshino Nakajima, Vice President of International Development for Home Instead Senior Care Senior Care and then international liaison for the franchise industry, was in search of quality in home care for her aging parents. After reading an article about Home Instead Senior Care Senior Care, Nakajima connected with Paul Hogan, founder of Home Instead Senior Care Senior Care to discuss taking the franchise concept abroad. \r\n “I was very impressed with Home Instead Senior Care’s brand promise of reliable, responsive, and trained caregivers who create an atmosphere of trust for clients and their families,” Nakajima stated. ““With the world’s aging population increasing, families, like mine, worldwide are in need of these meaningful services for their aging relatives.” \r\n According to Hogan, Nakajima’s enthusiasm and experience was just what the company was looking for in its pursuit of the international markets, and Nakajima was brought on board to develop international markets. \r\n “Our concept is very meaningful, and it’s not just about money, but making a difference for the elderly,” said Nakajima. “Doing business internationally presents many challenges, and for us, it’s finding people with the same core values and culture.” \r\n Looking beyond the U.S., Nakajima first decided to target the Japanese market, but soon faced many challenges. Recalling her prior experiences with the U.S. Commercial Service as a consultant for a food franchise company, Nakajima chose to enlist the services of the Omaha U.S. Export Assistance Center and its worldwide network. \r\n   \r\n “The selection of good partners, training, and the building relationships are the same key steps in the expansion of any franchise company internationally,” Nakajima stated. “At the Omaha assistance center I received market research, export counseling and requested partner searches that put me on the right path to entering the Japanese market.” \r\n New Concept, New Language \r\n By 1999, Nakajima had made great progress in developing a market entry strategy for Japan, but required additional information. With help from the Commercial Service and its Japan office, Nakajima participated in a franchising trade mission to Japan where the company’s services was showcased at Japan’s largest franchise show. While Home Instead Senior Care’s participation in the show created a lot of interest in the concept, the company faced a unique challenge—creating a new word for companionship. \r\n “Our concept of companionship (for senior citizens) did not exist in Japan,” Nakajima stated. “We had to focus on educating a community on the expanded meaning of companionship for the elderly and how our services could help families.” \r\n A press conference was held to introduce the new word konpanyanshippu to the Japanese community. Together with market research and trade show publicity generated by the Commercial Service, Home Instead Senior Care was able to initiate an effective market entry strategy for Japan. \r\n “Japan is the world’s second largest economy, and its family-oriented culture and aging population showed strong potential for introducing our services,” Nakajima stated. “With the assistance of the Commercial Service, we signed a master franchising agreement with Japan’s leading service-oriented provider that has generated 110 Japanese franchise offices.” \r\n Having succeeded in the Japanese market, Home Instead Senior Care wanted to then duplicate the “Japanese experience” in the South Pacific and Western European markets. According to Nakajima, while the Commercial Service’s export counseling and market research educated the company on conditions of the targeted markets, the Western European and South Pacific markets soon created new hurdles to overcome. \r\n Three Tiers of Europe \r\n “In Japan, the public was not concerned with the price so much as the type of service, where as in Europe, price was a major concern,” Nakajima remarked. “Instead of having to introduce the concept of companionship, we had to reclassify our services into three levels as a way for clients to save money.” \r\n In Portugal, two men approached Home Instead Senior Care about opening a franchise in Lisbon. The men had been unable to find the right level of care for their ailing parents without having to pay for unneeded services, and wanted to help other families with similar problems. Looking to start their own Home Instead Senior Care franchise, the businessmen signed an agreement with Home Instead Senior Care in 2003, and were helped through the licensing process by the Commercial Service’s Lisbon office. This initiated Home Instead Senior Care’s three-tiered marketing strategy for Europe. \r\n Taking Home Instead Senior Care’s new European marketing strategy to the next level, the company signed up for trade missions and the Commercial Service’s Gold Key Service that provides pre-arranged meetings abroad, enabling Home Instead Senior Care to identify and meet several potential partners whose candidate profiles paralleled the company’s ideal qualifications. The Commercial Service organizes trade missions to various locations for all types of industry, giving the U.S. business community the opportunity to connect with potential partners abroad. \r\n For example, the International Franchise Association and the Commercial Service co-sponsored a trade mission to Ireland in 2004 that included a dozen meetings with potential international buyers for Home Instead Senior Care. On St. Patrick’s Day, the company signed a master franchising agreement with two Irish businessmen in a market predicted to grow by 90 percent. \r\n “Trade missions are an excellent tool for finding intelligent, compassionate entrepreneurs to join the Home Instead Senior Care family,” Nakajima stated. “The missions saved us valuable time and resources that we could put towards enhancing our mission of providing quality care for senior citizens.” \r\n Along with Home Instead Senior Care’s accomplishments in Japan, Ireland, and Portugal, the company has signed master franchising agreements in Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand—all of which have enabled the company to open numerous franchises worldwide. In April 2006, the company signed to additional master franchising agreements in Taiwan and Spain. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Home Instead Senior Care’s successful domestic franchise operation coupled with its commitment to overcoming the challenging demands associated with international development has contributed to the company’s success in the international market, according to U.S. Commercial Service Trade Specialist Doug Barry, editor of A Basic Guide to Exporting where this case study appears. \r\n One challenge companies face in the international market is finding a good partner. Participating in a Commercial Service partner search allows companies, like Home Instead Senior Care, to save time and resources while connecting with potential international buyers in their targeted markets. \r\n In addition, Home Instead Senior Care learned to pay close attention to the targeted market’s social customs and ways of doing business when developing a market entry strategy. The Commercial Service is an excellent resource for learning about a country’s cultural issues and regulations. Companies, like Home Instead Senior Care, have found the Commercial Service’s customized market research to be especially helpful in initiating a market entry strategy. \r\n “We are now able to anticipate the challenges of new markets,” Nakajima stated. “We can depend on the Commercial Service to help us with overcoming licensing issues, finding the right partners, and additional challenges we face in future endeavors.” \r\n According to Nakajima, the company’s international success has contributed to its growth with the development of a new technology department in its international division that has created new jobs at the company’s headquarters—thus contributing to the local economy. The new technology department saves the company time and helps to ensure the quality of services. \r\n “We are fulfilling our mission of providing meaningful care for independent elders worldwide,” Nakajima stated, “Knowing the quality of life is being enhanced worldwide by our services makes me go to bed feeling good at night.” \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

Had China refused to certify Klinge’s refrigerated transportation containers and the paint to be applied to them before they were re-exported to Australia, Klinge could have lost the $8.5 million contract and potential future sales. \r\n The Problem:  In the midst of fulfilling an $8.5 million contract, Klinge Corp. ran into problems with Chinese customs officials, who improperly impounded a key paint component, claiming it failed to meet Chinese certification requirements. In addition, Chinese officials determined that Klinge’s refrigerator and generator units, who had previously been exempt from China’s Compulsory Certification (CCC) requirements, were suddenly subject to the CCC requirements. \r\n The Solution:  After a series of unproductive meetings with Chinese freight forwarders and customs officers, Klinge contacted MAC. In response, MAC invited representatives of Klinge to join other U.S. industry representatives in an ITA-sponsored roundtable in Ningbo, China, where the China Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) committed itself to intervene on behalf of the company. Concurrently, the ITA team raised the issue with Chinese officials, emphasizing China’s World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations. In a matter of months after the initial contact with MAC, Klinge obtained the necessary certification for the paint and received certification exemptions for the refrigerators and generators. China’s fulfilling its obligation under the WTO will also benefit other U.S. exporters to China who may face similar certification-related obstacles to trade.

Starting with its first export market in 1990, the company now supplies 800 products to labs in 56 countries. Of its $30 million in yearly sales, one-third comes directly from exports. In 1995, the company began to develop products that were less wasteful, and incorporate concepts of \"eco-efficiency\" using less packaging, recycled plastics, and refillable packages. \r\n The Success \r\n In 2007, Jim Happ, CEO of Labcon, North America, contacted the local U.S. Commercial Service (CS) office in North Bay, California to find out more about connecting with reliable overseas partners. Shortly thereafter, the CS encouraged Happ to attend a CS seminar on doing business in Singapore which provided information on opportunities in the country. The CS then worked with Labcon to develop market entry strategies, and with collaboration of CS Singapore, provided the company with the Gold Key matchmaking service and trade counseling. \r\n “The U.S. Commercial Service has saved us time and money. It could have taken us years of going through bad distributors until we found the right one, but we knew we could trust the companies the CS introduced us to,” said Happ. “Through the Gold Key Service, we interviewed with great potential partners, which was ended up being crucial to our success in Singapore.” \r\n Between 2007 and 2010, Labcon quadrupled its business in Singapore, and in the last year, has doubled its sales to Europe. Also boosting the firm’s international competitiveness are its redesigned products which use less packaging. As a result, the firm can ship 30 percent more volume on its overseas shipping containers, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. \r\n The Result \r\n Thanks in large part to its export sales, Labcon has weathered the economic downturn very well. For example, it has averaged overall growth of 20 percent, purchased its own building, contracted for an 800kw solar installation, and added ten new employees. In the last year alone, the company has experienced 25 percent overall growth of which 10 percent can be attributed to its export sales. \r\n The company continues to tap CS assistance as it looks to locate and establish partnerships around the world, including China, India, and Europe. Also high on the firm’s export agenda are the markets of Russia and Turkey. \r\n For those companies that have yet to export, Happ offers the following advice: “If you have a competitive product in the U.S., then your possibilities for being competitive overseas are very real. Exporting has made us a stronger company and more balanced financially, and it can work for your company as well.” \r\n In 2011, Labcon was awarded the “E” Award for Excellence in Exporting, presented by Secretary Locke. \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Contact your local U.S. Commercial Service Office.

Their process, district energy, is an efficient, environmentally responsible method of heating and cooling buildings. District energy systems produce steam, hot water or chilled water at a central plant. The steam or water is then piped underground to individual buildings within a designated area for heating, cooling or use in industrial processes. \r\n The Department of Commerce's U.S. Commercial Service and its offices in Saudi Arabia and the UAE was instrumental in Stellar's entry into the Middle East marketplace. \r\n For more on Stellar, go to www.Stellar.net. \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Stellar Receives Export Award at International District Energy Association Conference","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Environmental Technologies"],"topic":["Trade Counseling"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"161","content":" The Company \r\n Is your pet having a bad hair day? Well, Sharon Doherty, president of Vellus Products Inc., can help. Her small Columbus, Ohio–based company makes a line of pet grooming products, including customized shampoos, conditioners, brushing sprays, satin cream, and detanglers. \r\n According to Doherty, shampoos for people don’t work well on pets because animal skin is more sensitive than human skin and is more easily irritated. Most available pet shampoos, though sensitive to the skin, tend to leave hair unmanageable and without the glamour needed for the show dog or pampered pet. Dr. David Tanner, Doherty’s nephew, used his expertise as a chemist in the personal care industry to develop the salon-type formulas that Doherty thought would be good for animal hair and skin. This family-operated company also involves Doherty’s husband, Robert, and daughter, Teryl Hotz. \r\n  Sharon Doherty, President of Vellus Products, Inc. \r\n The Challenge \r\n Vellus Products’ first export sale occurred in 1993, when a Taiwanese businessperson, after trying the Vellus line, bought $25,000 worth of the company’s products to sell in Taiwan through dog shows. The word was out. “I started receiving calls from people around the world who would hear of our products at dog shows and ask organizers how they could get in touch with me to buy our products,” Doherty recalls. “But I needed a way to find market research and learn more about ways of doing business in these countries.” \r\n The Solution \r\n Doherty soon tapped the services of the U.S. Commercial Service in Columbus. “As business has grown, I have gone from ordering country profiles to requesting customized export and financing strategies tailored to maximize export potential,” Doherty says. \r\n The Commercial Service relied on its worldwide network and partners like the Small Business Administration and the state of Ohio to provide customized market research and information on financing and other programs for Vellus. Today, Vellus sells to more than 28 countries. “I credit the Commercial Service for helping me expand my exports, as it would have been much more difficult to do this on my own,” Doherty says. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Doherty learned several lessons from her exporting experience, as complied here by Doug Barry, editor of ABasic Guide to Exporting from which this case study is taken. \r\n \r\n  Know whom you are dealing with. “Developing business relationships is critical to successful exporting,” Doherty says. Doherty often gives advice and guidance to her distributors, sharing her knowledge and understanding of importing along with marketing in the dog show network. She says this advice is much appreciated and goes a long way toward building long-term relationships. “Be smart, but humble,” she advises. “Whenever there is a problem, I don’t e-mail; I pick up the phone.” \r\n Do a background check on potential business partners. Doherty was once duped by a businessman from another country who said he knew all about the pet market there. She followed some of his advice, and it caused her to lose customers in that country. The experience was a lesson well learned. “Always do a thorough check on your potential business partners,” she says. “Gather as much information as you can. Don’t make any assumptions; the wrong choice can cost your business valuable time and money.” Doherty also notes that it is her business practice to have orders prepaid by the purchaser, and once the bank receives the money, to ship the orders. This practice helps prevent any problems with delinquent payments. \r\n Learn the culture. Doherty has become familiar with the cultural aspects of pet care. Vellus shampoos and other products can easily be varied for different grooming techniques. In England, dog exhibitors prefer less pouffy topknots than those on show dogs in the United States, where owners tend to be more exotic with topknots. There also can be different preferences for the look of show dogs. \r\n Enjoy the ride. Doherty says that exporting has changed her life. “I love exporting because it has enabled me to meet so many people from other cultures. Exporting has made me more broad minded, and I have developed a great appreciation for other cultures and the way others live their lives,” she says. “You are put in contact with real people on the other side.” \r\n  \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

Overview \r\n Commercial Service (formally referred to as the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service) Certified Trade Missions are overseas events planned, organized, and led by federal agencies or non-federal export promotion organizations (such as industry trade associations, agencies of state and local governments, chambers of commerce, regional groups, and other export-oriented groups) in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce. \r\n Certified Trade Missions provide a flexible format in which to conduct overseas business. U.S. companies meet face to face with potential agents, distributors, joint venture partners, licensees, relevant businesses and government contacts. Seminars on local business practices with participation by banks, lawyers, and other authorities can be arranged. Special working level events are also available to further enhance the event, which may also include plant and factory tours or follow a seminar format for technical products. Within the mission's framework, Commercial Service overseas posts provide guidance and support to mission organizers and participating companies on the mission. \r\n B. Criteria \r\n To qualify for Commercial Service certification, the mission must have, as a primary objective, the promotion of U.S.-produced goods and services and/or the establishment of marketing representation abroad. Goods and/or services promoted must either be manufactured or produced in the United States, or, if manufactured or produced outside of the United States, be marketed under the name of a U.S. firm and have U.S. content representing at least fifty-one percent of the value of the finished goods or services. \r\n Products/services represented on the mission must be a compatible group within a product theme (or themes) that, in the Commercial Service's determination, offers substantial market opportunities. Single-industry theme (vertical) missions are preferable because promotional efforts can be targeted more effectively toward appropriate end-user audiences. Advance concurrence of the overseas posts on the product mix of the mission and its itinerary and timing is required. \r\n To participate in a Commercial Service Certified Trade Mission, the organizer must enter into a participation agreement with the post(s) hosting the mission. Generally, this agreement will incorporate the following Conditions of Participation, which post(s) and organizer may modify by mutual consent. Sponsoring organizations should apply by submitting an Application for Certified Trade Mission Organizers to the appropriate overseas post(s). \r\n Federal Government agencies seeking certification will coordinate through the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) events working group before approaching the overseas Commercial Service post(s). \r\n For additional information, please contact your nearest U.S. Export Assistance Center. \r\n C. Conditions \r\n Responsibilities of the Organizer \r\n The organizer shall: \r\n 1. Submit to the appropriate overseas post(s) a typed and signed Application for Certified Trade Mission Organizers (OMB No. 0625-0215--see attached form) as early as 12 months but no later than 6 months prior to the departure of the mission. \r\n Note: In unusual circumstances and when it is advantageous to the U.S. Government, the Commercial Service post in question may alter this requirement. \r\n 2. Upon notification of approval of the Application for Certified Trade Mission Organizers by the Commercial Service post involved, enter into a binding Participation Agreement (OMB No. 0625-0143) that incorporates the customized Conditions of Participation. A separate Conditions of Participation should be signed for each Commercial Service post involved. \r\n 3. Provide, at its expense, and identify to the overseas post a project officer, an advance officer, and a mission director not later than 90 days prior to the departure of the mission. Further, ensure that the advance officer and mission director carry out the responsibilities set forth in Sections C and D, below. \r\n Note: This requirement may be adjusted to meet the preferences of the Commercial Service post in question. Such adjustment will be agreed in writing between the organizer and the Commercial Service Post involved and made a part of the Conditions of Participation. \r\n 4. Work directly with the appropriate Commercial Service post to develop a comprehensive budget for the mission. It is understood and agreed that the budget will cover all services required to meet the needs of the mission. \r\n 5. Submit to the overseas post(s) complete payment of mission-related costs that the Commercial Service post(s) have agreed to incur overseas on the mission's behalf, not later than 60 days prior to the departure of the mission. Such costs may include, for example, expenses incurred for the following: Mission promotion, translation services, appointment scheduling, site rentals, secretarial assistance, over time of Commercial Service personnel, hospitality and transportation. Costs incurred directly by the sponsoring organization in connection with the mission will not be reimbursed by the Department. \r\n 6. Submit to the overseas office a final list of mission participants, product/service data, and precise business objectives of the mission participants (including any relevant company brochures) not later than 60 days prior to the departure of the mission. \r\n Note: At the discretion of the Commercial Service post, this requirement may be adjusted provided it is agreed in writing between the organizer and the Commercial Service post and made a part of the Conditions of Participation. \r\n 7. With guidance from the Commercial Service post, ensure that printed mission directories in appropriate quantities are received by the Commercial Service post 45 days prior to departure of the mission. The Commercial Service post will advise whether or not these should be translated into the language of the country. \r\n 8. Ensure that mission participation includes a minimum of five U.S.-based firms, with the maximum number of participants to be determined in agreement between the organizer and the Commercial Service post and made a part of the Conditions of Participation. \r\n 9. Comply, as appropriate, with the financial provisions of Section E and the bonding provisions of Section F, below. \r\n 10. Ensure that fee arrangements with participants do not include a commission on eventual sales or quantifiable results generated by the mission. \r\n 11. Ensure that all products and services promoted by mission participants are: \r\n (a) Manufactured or produced in the United States, or \r\n (b) If manufactured or produced outside of the United States, marketed under the name of a U.S. firm, with U.S. content representing at least fifty-one percent of the value of the finished goods or services. \r\n 12.

Provide the Department with a final mission report within 30 days after the conclusion of the mission, incorporating participants’ results and comments as reported in the distributed Mission/Exhibition Evaluation Survey. \r\n Responsibilities of the Commercial Service \r\n The certification of trade missions is administered by the Commercial Service at the overseas post(s). All decisions regarding the proposed mission are at the discretion of the Commercial Service. \r\n The Commercial Service post shall, within the limits of the agreed budget and personnel resources: \r\n 1. Designate the mission as an official Certified Trade Mission, recognizing the services of the sponsoring organization and of the mission participants in helping to increase the international commerce of the United States. \r\n 2. Ensure that the Certified Trade Mission is entered into the database of trade promotion events (e-Menu) on the Commercial Service intranet. \r\n 3. Provide advice and assistance from the planning stage to the conclusion of the mission. \r\n 4.

Assist in arranging business appointments for each mission participant; or, if resources are limited, assist a contractor of the sponsoring organization, working under the supervision of the affected overseas post(s), in identifying prospective customers, agents, distributors, investors and key government officials with whom business appointments can be made. \r\n 7. Arrange for commercial, economic, and political briefings, and assist in arranging relevant tours, inspections and seminars. \r\n 8. Facilitate use of the Embassy Press Office to publicize the mission abroad. \r\n 9. Collect a completed Mission/Exhibition Evaluation Survey from each participant before he/she departs the country. \r\n Note: Participants are not required to complete this form, but they will be encouraged to do so. \r\n U.S. Export Assistance Center  Trade Specialists (TSs) are expected to work closely with the organizers of CTMs and are encouraged to suggest the development of such missions, as appropriate. TSs should perform the following functions: \r\n \r\n 1. Provide background information to posts on specific organizations seeking CTM status, as known by the USEAC. Refer mission organizers to posts.  OIO must be copied on any communication originating from the USEAC relating to the status of the CTM. \r\n 2. If requested, develop market information packages for reproduction and dissemination by sponsoring mission organizer. \r\n 3. Publicize the mission in EAC newsletters and promote the mission to EAC clients who might be interested in participating. \r\n 4. EAC directors may assign a trade specialist as an in-house project officer to assist an individual CTM. \r\n 5. EAC trade specialists, if possible, should contact individual trade mission participants and provide those who are infrequent exporters with pre- and post-mission value added counseling that may lead to an export action. Counseling should include export financing documentation and market research. \r\n 6. Report all export successes and client feedback to posts and the OIO regional director. Be sure to credit post in export successes. \r\n \r\n Responsibilities of the Sponsoring Organizer's Advance Officer \r\n Where it is agreed between the Commercial Service post and the sponsoring organization that an advance officer is necessary, the advance officer shall: \r\n 1. Arrange a time in writing beneficial to both the appropriate Commercial Service post(s) and the partnership organization to begin his or her advance travel. Generally, this will be approximately 90 days prior to departure of the mission. \r\n 2. Confirm with each affected overseas post his or her specific itinerary and travel schedule not later than 15 days prior to his or her departure. \r\n 3. Carry information and product literature for each mission participant in sufficient quantities to leave at least one set at each affected overseas post. \r\n 4. Carry funds and international credit cards, with full authority to commit funds for mission expenses. \r\n 5. Work directly with each affected overseas post to develop the mission program and finalize the mission budget at each stop. \r\n Responsibilities of the Mission Director \r\n The sponsoring organization's mission director shall: \r\n 1. Ensure that mission participants adhere to the mission program and promptly keep all individual appointments at each stop. \r\n 2. Carry additional mission funds and international credit cards to ensure that all mission expenses not previously deposited with the Commercial Service post are paid before leaving each stop, and that mission participants' bills are similarly paid. \r\n 3. Ensure that each mission participant: \r\n (a) Is fully responsible for his or her individual travel and personal expenses; \r\n (b) Makes all necessary arrangements for entry permit visas and other travel documentation; \r\n (c) Is an active member or representative of his or her firm; and \r\n (d) Is qualified and authorized to quote prices and negotiate sales and other terms on behalf of his or her firm. \r\n Financial Provisions \r\n 1. Sponsoring organizations that are federal agencies or quasi-federal agencies shall: \r\n (a) Describe at the time of application where individual participation fees will be deposited, e.g., with the sponsoring agency or Commercial Service; \r\n (b) Describe at the time of application the method of payment to be used. Options include: \r\n ( I) Full payment by check (made payable to the U.S. Department of Commerce) with submission of Participation Agreement; \r\n (ii) Cable from agency to overseas post(s) transferring payment and authorizing spending; or \r\n (iii) Interagency transfer of funds with submission of Participation Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding; and \r\n (c) Provide original copies of payment documents to the Department for processing not less than 60 days prior to mission departure. \r\n 2. Sponsoring state organizations that are legally prohibited from providing prepayment as described in Section A shall provide to the Department not less than 60 days prior to mission departure a legally binding document, such as a purchase order in U.S. dollars or a letter of intent, committing to provide 50 percent of the mission budget, within 5 working days of the conclusion of the mission. The remaining balance is due upon receipt of final invoice(s) from the affected overseas post(s). Sponsoring organizations should contact the overseas post(s) for prior approval of language that purports to legally bind the organization. \r\n 3. All other sponsoring organizations will handle payment as described in C.A.5 and C.D.2 above unless agreed in writing and made a part of the \"Conditions of Participation.\" \r\n Bonding Provisions \r\n 1. For-profit sponsoring organizations shall obtain a bond from a surety company holding a certificate of authority from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Financial Management Service, as periodically published in the Federal Register. \r\n 2. The bond will ensure that a mission participant can recover a participation fee paid to the sponsoring organization, as well as any other reasonable pre-paid transportation costs, should the sponsoring organization fail to meet its obligations to the mission participant concerning the mission. \r\n The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover these fees and estimated transportation costs. \r\n 3. The bonding agreement must be signed by the sponsoring organization (principal) and a bonding company (surety). A bond beneficiary is defined as an individual or entity from which, or on behalf of which, the principal receives and retains a participant fee for the mission. \r\n 4. Bonds will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, as there is no standard form agreement. \r\n 5. An executed and pre-paid-in-full bond must be completed, and a copy of this bonding document shall be presented to the Commercial Service post before approval of the trade mission will be granted. \r\n 6. A copy of the bond must be made available to mission participants either by the sponsoring organization or the bonding company. \r\n 7. The bond requirement does not constitute a guarantee by the Department of reimbursement for financial losses to mission participants in connection with the mission. \r\n 8. Should either party terminate the bond agreement, the terminating party must notify the Department and make a reasonable effort to notify the bond beneficiaries. Therefore, the organizer must provide a listing of all mission participants, including valid mailing addresses, to the bonding company no later than 30 days prior to departure of the mission. \r\n Cancellations \r\n 1. All notice of cancellations must be in writing. Upon written notice of cancellation of the mission, the Department will secure an accounting by the affected overseas post(s) of costs incurred by them in connection with the mission. Such costs may include those incurred for fax/phone, postage, personnel overtime, printing, and contract services. If such costs exceed the amount previously received, or if no funds have been received, the Department will bill the sponsoring organization for the amount of the excess or its costs, as applicable. \r\n Acceptance of Terms \r\n On behalf of the partnership organization named in the attached Participation Agreement, I certify that I have read and understand the Conditions of Participation, which are incorporated into and form a part of said Agreement. \r\n Signature: __________________________________________________ \r\n Name and title: __________________________________________________ \r\n Organization: __________________________________________________ \r\n Date: __________________________________ \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Certified Trade Mission Conditions of Participation","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["Trade Missions"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"147","content":" Companies who use the Internet to reach overseas customers frequently use their website to process orders and accept payments. To ease international customers' use, companies should consider installing currency converters on the payment page. Additionally, as payment practices usually vary from country to country, it is important that the prevalent payment mechanisms be identified and incorporated into the order-processing component of the web site. A U.S. Commercial Service Trade Specialists in your target market can help you identify a country's most common payment mechanisms, which you should consider before commencing cross-border e-commerce in a particular market. \r\n Credit Card Payments \r\n For B2C transactions, many overseas customers use credit cards for online purchases, but credit cards are not a universally common method of online payment. For example, regulations in some countries hold cardholders liable for fraudulent charges, other countries are culturally cash-based, and others simply do not like credit. Nonetheless, to offer credit card payment services, a company must establish a credit card merchant account with a bank. The bank will process the transactions in exchange for a fee. Companies should compare the fee structures of banks to see which works best for the size and number of transactions expected. \r\n While fast, credit cards carry their risks. Chargebacks can be very costly for online exporters. Common chargeback reasons are: fraud, dispute over the quality of merchandise, non-receipt of merchandise, or amount charged to card was incorrect. Companies accepting online credit card transactions should be knowledgeable about their credit card and bank's policies toward chargebacks and how to avoid them. \r\n Account-to-Account (A2A) Transfers \r\n A2A transfers, in which money is transferred electronically between the customer's and merchant's bank, are popular in many countries. A2A transactions offer the advantages of occurring in real time and reducing the potential for fraud and chargebacks. Unfortunately, because A2A transactions are rare in the U.S., few U.S. banks currently offer this service. \r\n Person-to-Person (P2P) Transfers \r\n There are many companies offering P2P services, in which funds are sent electronically to a third party, which in turn deposits the funds in the merchant's account. An example of a P2P service provider that conducts cross-border transactions is PayPal. PayPal lets anyone with an email address securely send and receive online payments using their credit card or bank account. PayPal will also conduct currency exchange, allowing the customer and merchant to operate in their preferred currency. Internationally, P2P transfers have come under some degree of scrutiny (see a United Nations Discussion Paper about Informal Money Transfer Systems), so it is advisable to consult with a Commercial Service officer in the country you are targeting before deciding on a particular payment mechanism. \r\n Taxation \r\n An online merchant selling to international customers must pay careful attention to the tax implications of those sales. In general, once a company crosses a certain threshold of activity in a foreign country, the company becomes subject to income tax in that foreign country. In many cases, a company must have a \"permanent establishment\" in the foreign country before that country will subject the company to income tax on the company's business profits from that country. Thus, for example, an American online vendor of digitally- or physically- delivered products that does not have equipment or personnel in Japan generally would not be subject to Japanese income tax on its sales. However, there are important exceptions to this general rule. Some payments from customers in a foreign country may be subject to withholding tax by the foreign country (e.g., if the foreign country determines that the payments are \"royalties\" or other payments subject to withholding). \r\n Electronically delivered goods should be treated like any other sale to a foreign customer. It generally is the responsibility of the customer/importer to declare their purchase and pay any taxes. Tax and tariff information on a country-by-country basis is available, or contact a Commercial Specialist in the targeted country for more information. \r\n In addition, a foreign country may impose other types of taxes, such as value-added tax (VAT), on sales into its jurisdiction. For example, as of July 1, 2003, the EU member states began taxing sales of electronically supplied products and services by non-EU firms to non-business customers located in the EU. Non-EU providers of electronically supplied products and services are now required to register with a tax authority in a member state and collect and remit VAT based on the VAT rate of the member state where their customer is located. Additional information regarding taxation of hardware and software around the world can be found at the Department of Commerce's Office of Information Technology and Electronic website.

Loss of goods due to theft or damage can be managed to some degree through the choice of the port of entry or choice of shipping method. Some ports are more secure than others and are better equipped. If the goods in question require special handling then it is important that the chosen port is equipped to handle goods. For example perishable goods require a port where they can be handled quickly and where sufficient cold storage is available. If goods are fragile or of high value, then air freight may be preferable. \r\n It is important to be aware of when ownership passes from the buyer to the seller and thus risk of loss passes. This is typically defined within the INCOTERMS®. Not all losses can be prevented so it is important that sufficient cargo insurance be purchased. \r\n Goods can also be lost as a result of a scam. It is important to be able to recognizing a scam. Many scams contain similar features. A scam may contain some or all of these features or other elements as well. \r\n  A company is contacted by an unknown foreign buyer. The contact may be unexpected or there may be no obvious reason for the contact. \r\n The buyer seems to be unfamiliar with the goods. Scammers often have no particular need for the goods but see an opportunity for to easily obtain the goods or they can easily dispose of the goods. \r\n The buyer orders an extraordinary quantity of goods. \r\n The buyer is willing to pay full retail price especially when less expensive alternative sources are available. \r\n The buyer wants the goods shipped immediately, often by expressed freight, and is not concerned about the cost. \r\n The buyer offers to pay in advanced by credit card or cashier’s or certified check. None of these are secure methods of payment. The burden is on the seller to verify the validity of these methods of payment. It can take two weeks or longer for stolen or fraudulent credit card numbers to be registered in the banking system. U.S. banks will give you immediate credit for checks that are deposited. This is called a provisional credit and does not mean the check is valid. The provisional credit is subject to being revoked if the check does not clear. It can take two weeks or more for a check to be determined as fraudulent. \r\n  Many scams originate from West Africa or some part of the Pacific Rim. \r\n Remedy: There is no adequate method to recover goods lost in the course of an international scam. \r\n Prevention: The key to avoiding scams is to conduct due diligence on the buyer and use a secure method of payment with unfamiliar buyers. \r\n There are various approaches to conducting due diligence: \r\n  Conduct a credit check through a bank \r\n Perform a full background check \r\n Verify provided references \r\n  To ensure payment, review the Trade Finance Guide: A Quick Reference for U.S. Exporters.

Garmin products were improperly held up for failing to meet adequate testing despite using the correct process for meeting the European Union’s marking requirements. \r\n Why it Matters: Turkish customs had misinterpreted the marking rules for the Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive and this prevented Garmin from selling its marine navigational GPS units in Turkey. It is important that the marking rules be interpreted uniformly across all the European Union countries including Turkey so companies can take advantage of the single market. \r\n \r\n The Problem: Turkish customs had detained a shipment of Garmin’s marine navigational GPS units in February 2011. Turkish customs claimed that the CE Mark Directive on Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment (R\u0026amp;TTE) required that these products be tested and certified at a third party lab recognized by the European Union (EU). However, the R\u0026amp;TTE Directive allows for the marine navigational GPS units imported by Garmin to be self-certified. Garmin asserted that it used the correct European standards and received a test result from an independent U.S. lab to demonstrate that it met the requirements of the standard. \r\n The Solution: ITA officials, working in close collaboration with the Commercial Service at the U.S. Embassy in Turkey, worked with Turkish government officials to explain that marine navigational GPS units can be self-certified by an accredited independent lab, in compliance with the relevant EU standard. As a result, Turkish customs officials correctly assessed Garmin’s products and accepted its self-certification. Garmin reported in May that its most recent shipments to Turkey had gone through customs smoothly and the company does not anticipate any trouble getting these products into Turkey in the future. After resolving this issue, Garmin’s senior compliance officer attested that “we’ve had a very close relationship with the Commerce Department in the past, and this is just another example of help they’ve given us.” \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas. “We promote policy that develops a more favorable business climate for U.S. companies in global markets; we employ commercial diplomacy to resolve trade barriers; and we leverage our bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to ensure our trading partners live up to their commitments so that our businesses can compete on a level-playing field,” said Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance, Michael C.

Air Products' specialty gases are supplied to Taiwan's manufacturers for use in many of Taiwan's high tech industries. Taiwan's authorities temporarily halted a shipment of these gases, claiming that trailers built to U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) standards were not acceptable for the transport of the specialty gases within Taiwan. Although Taiwan authorities released the shipment as a temporary solution, Taiwan’s failure to permanently permit the transport of specialty gases in DOT-certified containers would have resulted in a loss of considerable revenue as well as industry competitiveness for Air Products in Taiwan. \r\n Solution: A team of ITA specialists advocated to Taiwan's authorities on behalf of Air Products to accept the DOT standard, thereby allowing shipments to resume.\u0026amp; The team leveraged Taiwan's WTO obligation which requires that Member countries ensure that mandatory standards are no more trade restrictive than necessary. As a result, Taiwan officially adopted the DOT standard, and Air Products regained access to one of its most important foreign markets without having to restructure its manufacturing process for a single market. \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas.

(AGI), of Exton, PA, develops software applications and development tools for timely and cost-effective development and deployment of space, defense and intelligence missions. AGI products are used for modeling, engineering and operations in the areas of space, cyberspace, aircraft, missile defense, C4ISR and electronic systems. For example, AGI software is utilized to identify space debris, develop government defense planning budgets, track satellite orbits and for a variety of other purposes. Started in CEO Paul Graziani’s living room in 1989, AGI has since grown to 200 employees in its U.S. headquarters and more than 270 employees in total. To date, AGI has expanded into 13 foreign markets, and its growing global presence led the company to be recognized with the U.S. Commerce Department’s Export Achievement Award in 2010. \r\n The Challenge \r\n AGI began exporting in the mid to late 1990’s. However by 2008, exports had become an integral part of its strategic plan. Matt Glenn, Manager of International Operations at AGI, together with the company’s senior management, first wanted to expand export opportunities in Europe and Asia by targeting foreign government and space programs. Although AGI already had strong business relationships in Europe, the company sought assistance on connecting with Asian partners and understanding the various business cultures in the region. AGI also needed to prioritize which markets to enter and address issues such as language customization and international training. \r\n \r\n Matt Glenn, Manager of International  Operations at AGI \r\n The Solution \r\n Glenn contacted the U.S. Commercial Service’s (CS) Philadelphia office to get guidance in drafting an export plan for Asia. The CS set up meetings for AGI with potential partners in the region, including Japan and South Korea. Glenn states “Since the U.S. Commercial Service had already made the key contacts and extended business invitations appropriate to the business culture of the country, our sales teams could focus more on the presentation and sale of our products.” \r\n After its initial success in Asia, the company set up a subsidiary office in Singapore to serve as an Asian base from which they could do further business in the region. Having the Asian subsidiary would help AGI better communicate with its Asian partners and customers. CS Philadelphia worked closely with CS Singapore in taking AGI through the steps in setting up a foreign subsidiary. \r\n AGI uses a dual selling strategy with the various countries it does business with. In some markets like the United Kingdom, the firm sells directly; while in other markets such as South Korea, AGI utilizes software reseller partners. In the next five years, AGI hopes to increase its international sales as a percentage of overall sales from the current 12 percent to a projected goal of 20-40 percent. “We’ve seen a direct impact on our international sales as a result of U.S. Commercial Service assistance,” Glenn said. “Jobs supported by exports at our company have increased from 6 to 11 in the past two years, and we foresee adding many more new jobs in the not-too-distant future as international sales continue to grow.” \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Glenn says a key lesson AGI learned was the importance of choosing the right international partners. In the past, when the company met with international partners on its own, it was either a hit or a miss. However, through the CS, the firm was able to access potential pre-screened partners. “The Gold Key program is a very good way to ensure that when we add a partner to our network, it is one that is highly respected in the target country,” he adds. “After all, our partners are charged with the management of AGI’s global brand. Conversely, our partners want to know and trust that the U.S. company is a good long-term fit for their own business growth strategy.” \r\n The CS global network of export professionals helped AGI overcome barriers by providing information on establishing overseas networks and operations, guiding the company in targeted marketing and advising them in areas such as intellectual property. Glenn’s advice to other U.S. exporters: “Don’t just strike out on your own, take advantage of the U.S. Commercial Service. They are familiar with the ways of doing business in your market destination and know how U.S. companies can succeed there. It’s saved us valuable time and resources.” \r\n Creating a formal strategic export plan has been crucial in setting up AGI’s international operations, helping get top management buy-in for long-term export goals, and helping the firm anticipate future resource needs. For example, Graziani, AGI’s CEO and co-founder, believes strongly that part of the strategic plan is to “create high quality and high-tech jobs” as foreign sales increase. \r\n Glenn also recommends participating in trade missions, having participated in several in the past. He states, “For small to medium-sized businesses like us who are looking to expand into a large diverse market, participating in a trade mission can be very worthwhile. During trade missions to South Korea and Singapore, the U.S. Commercial Service set up one-on-one meetings with potential customers for us and provided briefings on specific market opportunities. Recently we participated in an aerospace trade mission to Brazil, which led to making a sale worth more than $100,000.” \r\n With these lessons in mind, AGI is excited about future business prospects with Brazil and India, and considers Russia a possible new market. \r\n Action \r\n Here are some tips on exporting to new markets \r\n \r\n  Create a formal strategic plan for your exporting efforts. Outline your company’s goals and identify where you need to add resources. \r\n Utilize the Commercial Service’s Gold Key Matching Service. AGI used this service to connect with pre-screened international partners. \r\n Attend a trade mission. This will give you a feel for the market and give you the chance to meet one on one with prospective partners and customers. \r\n Consider different strategies for different countries. AGI uses a direct selling strategy in countries such as the United Kingdom, and utilizes reseller partners in countries such as Japan, South Korea, India and others. \r\n  ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Success Stories: Analytical Graphics, Inc.","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Aerospace \u0026 Defense"],"topic":["Market Intelligence"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"202","content":" The Company \r\n Chocolate vases, squares of vanilla fudge, and sugar-free lemon drops—what better way to grow a business than appealing to the world’s sweet tooth? Margaret McEntire, founder, president, and chief executive officer of Candy Bouquet International, thought so. Her firm is now the largest candy franchise in the world. But it wasn’t always that way. Candy Bouquet started as a one-room operation in 1989, but by 1995, McEntire was looking to expand her business overseas. \r\n The Challenge \r\n McEntire says her biggest challenges have been learning more about business practices in different cultures, gaining key market information, and learning about channels of trade. Educating foreign businesspeople about American franchises is another challenge, and so is describing what a candy bouquet is. The company has had to explain the concept of rolling a candy store and a florist together and making a product that is really all candy. \r\n  Candy Is Dandy: Margaret McEntire  Set Up Candy Bouquet Franchises  Around the Globe \r\n The Solution \r\n In 1995, McEntire attended a trade show in Washington, D.C., where she met a trade specialist from the U.S. Commercial Service. That connection led to her participation in a Commercial Service mission to Eastern Europe and introduced her to doing business in foreign markets. \r\n In the years that followed, Candy Bouquet expanded to dozens of foreign countries. The company’s unique franchising system allows individuals to make a single purchase into the franchise and pay no continual overhead. The only requirement is that their supplies must come from the Candy Bouquet warehouse in Little Rock. \r\n “One of the most helpful things I’ve found in doing foreign business is having a person we know in that country to help us out,” says McEntire, referring to the Commercial Service’s worldwide network of trade specialists. She credits much of her success to Dennis Millard, a trade specialist at the Little Rock Export Assistance Center. “When I know a foreign franchisee is coming, I call Dennis at our local U.S. Commercial Service office, and he provides me with solid information on the business practices of that culture.” \r\n Millard has also helped her take advantage of many Commercial Service programs. Candy Bouquet participates annually in the International Franchise Trade Show and has taken part in trade missions around the world. In 1999, McEntire participated in the Women in Business Matchmaker Trade Mission to South America and the Women’s Economic Summit of the Americas in Buenos Aires, Argentina. McEntire is also a frequent participant in Commercial Service global video teleconferencing. She is a regular presenter at the international trade events sponsored by the Little Rock Export Assistance Center and shares her experiences with other businesses that are new to exporting. McEntire also advertises in Commercial News USA, a product catalog produced by the Commercial Service and distributed to more than 400,000 overseas buyers. \r\n With assistance from the Commercial Service, Candy Bouquet has expanded from a single-room operation to more than 700 franchises in more than 40 countries. McEntire says, “Nobody likes to pay taxes but [the Commercial Service] is the best use of my tax dollars.” \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n McEntire has several lessons to pass along to new exporters, said Doug Barry, editor of A Basic Guide to Exporting in which this case study appears. \r\n \r\n  Adapt your product for other cultures. In one instance, McEntire was trying to sell chocolate vases in Malaysia, but there were few takers: “We discovered that Malaysians … thought the chocolate pieces were too big. So we got the idea of ordering sample sizes from the manufacturer, and it did the trick.” \r\n Educate yourself about local practices. On one occasion, McEntire shipped candy to Saudi Arabia in boxes that bore pictures of women’s hands holding drinking glasses. Saudi Arabians don’t drink, so their customs bureau returned the boxes. On another occasion, McEntire invited three potential Candy Bouquet franchise owners from Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to visit her home for training. The gentleman from the UAE eventually wanted to pray. “Margaret,” he asked, “which way is Mecca?” McEntire has learned to be prepared for any cultural contingency. \r\n Realize that there will be setbacks. One such setback occurred in Cairo, where women seldom start their own businesses. Much of the candy that her franchisees had ordered was burned on the airport tarmac. Eventually, many of the women were able to persuade their husbands to join in as business partners, making the venture more socially acceptable. \r\n Protect your intellectual property. In China, someone copied McEntire’s brand name and then tried to order additional candy from her. Fortunately, other Candy Bouquet franchisees in China informed McEntire about what was going on. She is now pursuing legal action. \r\n Enjoy your work. “I love my job; it’s fun to go around the world to help people eat candy and chocolate,” McEntire says. “We are changing the face of the world with a brand-new industry, and it is very gratifying to see our franchises succeed and help the local economy. If you do what you love, you will never work a day in your life.” \r\n  \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

Robert Allen, CEO, was originally a senior partner for an Internet service provider but was inspired to enter the coffee industry, and started buying green coffee beans in small quantities, roasting and reselling them. In 2006, he created Coffee \u0026amp; More LLC, an idea which grew into a business selling over 36 varieties of coffee, and which recently expanded with a line of teas and chocolates. The company buys the best coffee beans from around the world, and adheres to a “one world” concept of making sure all the humans and animals used in the production process are treated with dignity and respect. Their coffee is sold to private users, government offices, businesses, schools, coffee shops, and specialty stores. \r\n \r\n Basket of assorted Coffee \u0026amp; More goods \r\n The Challenge \r\n Coffee is the second-most traded commodity in the world after oil, so Coffee \u0026amp; More needed to come up with a way to differentiate its products from the competition. Drinking coffee is a cultural experience, and the way coffee is roasted and prepared differs from country to country. “In some countries people drink coffee with a consistency of molasses, while others like their coffee to be weaker, more like tea,” said Allen. “People thought we were cutting our throats by exporting, and I admit we had our own doubts. However, we knew the customer base for our product outside the United States was large, and so was the potential for success.” \r\n The Solution \r\n Coffee \u0026amp; More started working with the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) San Antonio office early on. In 2007, Allen participated in the “San Antonio Export Leaders Program,” a program created by the City of San Antonio, the U.S. Commercial Service, and the University of Texas San Antonio. During the training, Allen received trade counseling, customized market research, and information on market entry strategies. The export planning and preparation served Allen’s business philosophy, “that in business, people do not prepare to fail, they fail to prepare.” As a result of knowledge gained from the program, Coffee \u0026amp; More made large international sales to Mexico and Italy. CS San Antonio collaborated with the Foreign Agricultural Service and CS offices abroad, and continued to assist Coffee \u0026amp; More as it successfully exported to Iraq, Australia, and Japan. \r\n “Now international exporting has become an integral part of the company,” says Allen. “Our international exports went from 2% of annual income in 2005 to 60% of annual income in 2009, and we’ve been able to add more jobs. \r\n Coffee \u0026amp; More’s exporting strategy focuses on what they do best: offering quality products and service while giving back to the community. \r\n “Customers buy coffee the way they want it with a promise of quality, purity and freshness. If we fail on any point, the order is replaced or refunded,” says Allen. Since each customer receives a customized product, we are effectively addressing cultural differences in coffee drinking.” \r\n Based on the success of Coffee \u0026amp; More and the knowledge gained through exporting, Allen started an export management company, Stoic International, which helps other companies learn about exporting. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n CEO Robert Allen states, “My advice to other companies considering exporting is to go for it, but be smart and do your homework first. Educate yourself and use your local U.S. Commercial Service office. If it was not for the CS San Antonio office I would be out of business, there is no doubt about that!” \r\n Allen recommends getting insurance on all international orders, and establishing a relationship with a broker/forwarder. “Do not change the way you do business just because it is international. Good business is good business everywhere,” says Allen. \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Identify your drivers of success. Coffee \u0026amp; More identified the launching of a quality product and responsiveness to customers as key factors to attaining success in domestic and international markets. \r\n Get a freight forwarder/customs broker. They will ensure your products are delivered on time. \r\n Use your local U.S. Commercial Service office. CS trade specialists will connect you to the resources and information you need. Like Coffee \u0026amp; More, you can participate in local or virtual events, to help enhance your knowledge on exporting. \r\n  ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Success Story: Coffee \u0026 More, LLC","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Agribusiness"],"topic":["Trade Counseling"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"194","content":" The Company \r\n Established in 1990, San Diego-based Evertek Computer Corp. sells new and refurbished computers and parts. The demand for “obsolete” computer equipment is large and growing because buyers around the world don’t need the latest and most expensive equipment. They want cheap. Match these folks with people who want to make a few bucks off their used personal computers, printers, and monitors, and you have a business with serious growth potential. \r\n The Challenge \r\n Evertek international sales manager John Ortley wanted to grow the global side of the business. Given the company’s small sales staff, Ortley thought Evertek should emphasize e-commerce Web sites and portals. To scale up fast and keep ahead of the competition, Ortley elected to focus on countries with lower gross national products. \r\n  John Ortley, International Sales  Manager of Evertek Computer Corp. \r\n The Solution \r\n Evertek established sales channels, including an e-commerce Web site and a multilingual sales staff of just three people. Ortley also used the buyer-finding services of the U.S. Commercial Service. \r\n The Export Assistance Center in San Diego helped Ortley pick the best overseas trade shows to attend to promote Evertek’s products. One such show, CeBIT in Germany, generated $1 million in orders—well worth the plane fare and hotel room. “Any company in the U.S. with sales of $5 million per year should be exporting,” says Ortley. “And they should be using the U.S. Commercial Service to help them do it.” \r\n In just a few years, Ortley was able to add four new salespeople. International sales zoomed to $34 million last year, an increase of 84 percent from the previous year. He thinks future annual sales of $100 million are attainable, especially since he now sells to customers in 105 countries, including Iraq. About 30 percent of Evertek’s international customers are in South America, with 20 percent in Europe and 20 percent in the Middle East and North Africa. \r\n International sales are good for Evertek not only because of the volume and balancing business cycles, but also because gross margins are higher and merchandise returns have been “next to nil.” Ortley says the return rate for domestic sales is between 3 and 5 percent. \r\n Payment also has not been an issue for Evertek. The firm uses a combination of wire transfers, credit cards, and letters of credit. “For certain high-risk countries, we only ship upon receipt of a wire transfer to our bank,” says Ortley. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n The chief lesson Ortley learned is that a small sales department can use the Internet to find and sell to customers all over the world. Because multiple channels are a key to growth, Ortley has a presence on e-commerce portals such Alibaba.com and Singapore-based Exporters.sg. About half of Evertek’s international sales are generated through the Internet and half through trade shows and other methods more suited to “an older-style sales company,” explains Ortley. He adds that even e-commerce sales are seldom entirely devoid of human contact because of the need to deal with documentation issues and the desire of many foreign customers to have a personal relationship with the company they are buying from. \r\n Ortley spends hours on the phone, adjusting his calls throughout the day for different time zones. Speaking directly with the client is still an essential part of the business process, he believes, because it forges closer ties. “I sit there making calls with the CIA’s World Factbook on my computer screen. It’s important to know something about the country you’re doing business in. The buyers really appreciate it if you can talk to them about issues of importance to them.” \r\n Ortley also uses an array of free and low-cost help to build his international business. Trade leads from the Commercial Service are one good source of reliable buyers. Advertising in Commercial News USA, the Commercial Service’s magazine, is another. U.S. embassies across the globe distribute the magazine, which features editions in English, Spanish, and Chinese. \r\n Ortley’s enthusiasm for doing business abroad has helped Evertek realize that a big part of its business is going to be international: “For me it started with being curious about the world. I enjoy learning about other cultures and respecting people who have a different background than mine.” Ortley says the company’s owners were always open to doing business globally, but he has been able to deliver results that have positioned the company as a major exporter. \r\n Ortley advises companies to consider the potential rewards of exporting and of working with the Commercial Service. “We are in part an e-commerce business and we’re thriving. The world is shrinking, and it’s getting easier and less expensive to do business on a global basis.” \r\n Action \r\n Here are some tips for taking your e-commerce business global: \r\n \r\n  Answer purchasing inquiries from overseas, even if unsolicited. The Commercial Service advises that you respond to such inquiries if only to request additional information about the potential buyer. If you are concerned about the legitimacy of the buyer, the Commercial Service can do a background check or provide other useful information that can help your company make its decision. \r\n Advertise in Commercial News USA. This bimonthly catalog-style magazine helps American companies promote products and services to buyers in more than 145 countries. The magazine, which is free, is mailed directly to qualified recipients and distributed by Commercial Service personnel at U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide. Each issue reaches an estimated 400,000 readers. \r\n Get on line. Companies that have decided to sell their products on line must assess whether they have the most efficient information technology (IT) solutions to execute their on-line exporting programs. The U.S. Department of Commerce has created a tool to assist companies with IT assessment which is available free on the Internet. The eScan Security Assessment assesses the electronic-security infrastructure of a small or medium-sized business and provides an action plan for improvement.

Multi-ply coins possess a unique electro magnetic signature (EMS) which provides for greater coin security. They are also more wear resistant and harder to counterfeit than regular coins. \r\n The Challenge \r\n In late 2008 and early 2009, a financial crisis hit the world economy resulting in unemployment, foreclosures, and stock market collapses. Unemployment hit 10.6% at its height nationally in 2010, however, in Greene County, Tennessee, a rural county adjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains; unemployment hit a staggering 17.9% at its height. During the economic downturn, Mark Blizard, Vice President of Coinage Sales for Jarden Zinc Products, turned towards export markets to maintain factory production and grow sales for his company. By monitoring public tenders for public coinage, Mr. Blizard found a bid for coin banks issued by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the central bank of the Philippines. Although several technologies were available, Blizard sought to promote the most cost effective and secure alternative. \r\n The Solution \r\n Mr. Blizard contacted his local U.S. Commercial Service (CS) office in Knoxville, Tennessee for advice. \r\n The CS staff in Knoxville quickly contacted the CS office in Manila, Philippines to form a team to work on the issue. From June 2009 through January 2010, CS staff counseled Jarden on strategies to successfully present its advanced technology to the BSP. After several meetings with the Pilipino government and extensive counseling with Jarden staff over a period of seven months, the company was officially awarded the contract with BSP to supply and deliver 4,610 metric tons of 1-Piso coins at a total contract price of $21 million using the multi-ply technology. The contract period of two years is the first ever for a U.S. firm to break into the Philippine market for minted coinage. “The U.S. Commercial Service was helpful in communicating with our agent, monitoring the bidding process on our behalf, and communicating with the BSP,” said Blizard. \r\n The Result \r\n Winning this order allowed Jarden Zinc Products to retain jobs that had been at risk, and to recall over twenty employees from layoffs necessitated by the prior year’s economic downturn. Additionally, securing this order led to approximately 15 new jobs at the Greeneville, Tennessee facility. Blizard strongly encourages other U.S. companies to export. “Having a global presence has been essential in Jarden’s growth. The diversity of the opportunities abroad has provided us with the ability to prosper even during challenging economic times in the U.S. domestic market.” \r\n For their accomplishments in the Philippines, Jarden Zinc received an Export Achievement Certificate from the U.S. Commercial Service, presented by Congressman Roe of Tennessee in May 2011. “We are extremely honored to have received the Export Achievement Certificate, and it was especially gratifying to receive it from Congressman Roe at our plant in Greeneville, in front of many of our employees,” said Blizard. \r\n \r\n Jarden Zinc Products staff receives Export Achievement Certificate from Congressman Roe. \r\n Left to right– Rob Leach, Director of the Knoxville U.S. Export Assistance Center, U.S. Commercial Service; Chuck Villa, President, Jarden Process Solutions; Congressman Phil Roe; Thomas Wennogle, President, Jarden Zinc Products; Ian Ashken, Vice Chairman and CFO, Jarden Corporation; Mark Blizard, Vice President Coinage Sales, Jarden Zinc Products; Mark Drury, Tennessee Assistant Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development \r\n Action \r\n Contact your local U.S. Commercial Service Office. U.S. Commercial Service staff in Knoxville connected with CS staff in Manila to ensure the fair bidding process for the contract with BSP. \r\n Export to grow your company’s sales. Jarden Zinc’s contract with BSP enabled them to weather the economic downturn and hire additional staff. \r\n Participate in a U.S. Commercial Service event. Go to export.gov to browse upcoming trade shows, trade missions, webinars, and other events.

At first the business focused on equipment for people with disabilities to help them in their homes. \r\n Young remembers burning through the investment money pretty fast with limited success in building the business. He and his partners hired a new CEO and in 1992 formed SCIFT Systems Inc. New product lines included physical therapy equipment, then exercise machines. They designed cardio equipment and predicted that the wellness market was moving towards an emphasis on physical fitness. \r\n  SCIFT Systems Inc. \r\n The new formula and management worked and SCIFIT now has 50 employees including engineers and other specialists who do limited product assembly, the rest of which is contracted out. The company main customers are fitness clubs and hospitals. \r\n Rather than waiting until the company was firmly established in its home market, SCFIT pursued international sales from the beginning. To Young’s surprise his U.S. competitors were not well known overseas. At first, clients in England, Ireland and Korea were picked up by accident. \r\n “An Irishmen, who’d read about us on our website, called me one day from San Francisco. ‘I’ll pay your expenses if you come to visit us,’ I told him.” He came, Young paid, and the visitor became a distributor for SCIFIT. \r\n Exporting expanded quickly and now accounts for nearly 20% of sales. International sales are growing about 15% per year. “The U.S. market is 50 to 60% of the world market, so you can imagine the demand as certain populations age and become more affluent,” Young said. SCIFIT has customers in more than 30 countries. “We are well-established in Japan, where demand is strong, and are moving into Italy and Spain.” \r\n In each of these markets SCIFIT received assistance by trade professionals at the U.S. Commercial Service. “We’ve worked with the Commercial Service for 20 years,” recalls Young. “I was 30 and with a new company. I called the organization. Don’t remember why. It was telexes then, and the trade specialist sent a bunch to her colleagues abroad. I got inundated with requests and I got into all kinds of new markets.” \r\n After all this time, Young still considers it essential to involve the U.S. government in his business—in a totally positive way. \r\n “Thanks to my previous work with the Commercial Service and my own experience, I know a lot about the export process including financing, trade law and logistics,” said Young. “But the Commercial Service saves me time and money, and the legitimacy the U.S. government gives me in market after market is just invaluable.” \r\n SCIFIT’s fastest overseas market entry was in 2005 into Brazil. Young did prep work with his local Commercial Service office in Tulsa and with the Commercial Service office in Sao Paulo in August. He then traveled to Sao Paulo later that month, and attended a fitness trade show there in September. In October, he was selling product. \r\n He was assisted in Sao Paulo by U.S. Commercial Service specialist Patricia Marega, who follows the Brazilian fitness industry and spends time cultivating best of breed distributors. Young used the Gold Key Service in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro which matches U.S. suppliers with overseas buyers and distributors. \r\n “Patricia did a great job researching the market for us,” said Young. “We had 20 interviews in 4 days. The Commercial service people asked great questions of the candidates. If I wasn’t covering my butt, Patricia was.” \r\n “Bo was extremely impressed with one of our local clients, Portico Artigos Esportivos,” said Maregas. “We went to their factory and met their distributor. The fact that the U.S Commercial Service was accompanying Bo to this meeting made the Brazilians comfortable.” \r\n “We settled on one distributor for the entire country,” said Young, “Because we found that if you have more, they start competing with each other and pretty soon they’re cutting the prices on each other.” \r\n And that distributor wanted SCIFIT’s equipment for the big trade show only a month after the deal was made. A month is normally not enough time to ship large pieces of equipment and clear customs. Again, Marega went to work and successfully expedited the goods through customs in time for the show. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n It took three months for SCIFIT to enter Brazil, six years to enter Japan. Does this mean your business should forget about Japan? The answer is no, according to Young, because there are things of value to learn about your business, products and yourself from every market you enter. \r\n “The Japanese will absolutely improve your product,” says Young. “They can see more things wrong with what you make than any other culture. They’ll check everything. ‘On the left side of this piece of equipment you have two different screws. Why?’ If our software has 20 stages in it, they’ll suggest a way to reduce it to 10. These insights are very valuable to our competitiveness in all markets.” \r\n In England, SCIFIT partnered with the British government and improved paint bases and also added instructions in Braille. “Australians helped us identify a new and better tread for our treadmill machines. “We tell them: ‘don’t be afraid to tell us how we can improve our products.’” \r\n From his export partners, Young learned that business is about relationships. “We Americans tend to be colder or in too big of a hurry,” observes Young. “Building relationships has become a mantra in our company. Invite your customers home. Stay in their homes. Send flowers when they’re in the hospital. Remember birthdays of wives and children. When my daughter got married, she got gifts from my distributors.” \r\n Young laments that U.S. companies and businesspeople are on the whole “myopic.” He says: “Mention a letter of credit and people’s eyes glaze over. Most people don’t even have passports.” \r\n If they only knew what’s possible. I have the best job in the world. I travel around visiting friends.” \r\n Next steps \r\n Check out websites in other countries where the Commercial Service has offices. There you’ll find local trade events, directories of specialists in your industry, and links to other useful information about doing business. \r\n The Commercial Service offers a number of channels for meeting qualified buyers: the Gold Key Service, the product catalog Commercial News USA, and the Export Yellow Pages. The last two products are joint ventures with private sector partners and have a circulation focused on foreign buyers. An on-line service, Featured U.S. Exporter, is available on most Commercial Service country websites and includes product descriptions and links to the exporter’s web site. \r\n Trade shows, which provide Commercial Service assistance to U.S. producers and foreign buyers, are a proven way of generating sales. The Commercial Service certifies more than 100 overseas trade shows that have U.S. pavilions and recruits international buyer delegations for more than 40 major U.S. trade shows. \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

How SMC engineered its way into China provides a model that may benefit other U.S. firms eager to sell to this booming market of 1.3 billion consumers. \r\n The Company \r\n SMC, a division of the Spancrete Group, employs 45 people in its Waukesha, Wisconsin, production facility. The firm, founded by Henry Nagy, manufactured the first precast hollow-core slabs in North America in 1952. SMC, which sells its equipment worldwide under license agreements and direct sales, is a client of the U.S. Commercial Service Export Assistance Center in Milwaukee. \r\n SMC entered China in the late 1980s. It wanted to incorporate licensing agreements, but the Chinese government forbade such arrangements. SMC opted to sell the machinery outright. Nevertheless, SMC’s hollow-core machines were the first foreign equipment of that type sold in China. \r\n The Challenge \r\n The early years were challenging, concedes Terry Dittrich, SMC’s international sales manager: “Our customers were state-owned enterprises, and the Chinese government encouraged them to expand into the precast construction business, despite their limited knowledge of this sector.” \r\n The Solution \r\n Those companies started by producing floor slabs, SMC’s most basic product, but local architects and engineers had limited experience with precast products of this type. Even in a state-controlled economic system, companies need effective marketing to generate sales. To better support the companies, SMC began assisting with seminars for these state-owned enterprises and the construction community in general. \r\n SMC’s next achievement was to establish the China Spancrete Association, probably the first organization of its kind. The association is a non-profit support organization for SMC’s Chinese customers, assisting them in technical, production, and marketing procedures. “At first, the Chinese didn’t understand the concept of a professional association,” explains Dittrich. “They said, ‘Why should we pay dues to belong to something like this? Why should we cooperate with people outside of our own enterprise?’ It’s not how they operated. Now they can see the value and continue to expand the association’s efforts.” \r\n Working through the association, SMC pooled the existing knowledge for the benefit of all members. The association tackled the lack of codes and standards, making recommendations on matters like the loads that floors can safely carry and conducting research on seismic and fire-safety issues. Ultimately, SMC, with the association, achieved the registration of Spancrete–China products in the national building and design code. \r\n Business processes are changing rapidly in China, and competitors are getting more aggressive. Also, the economic boom has moved south and west of where it started, creating more opportunities and challenges. Recently, Dittrich used the Commercial Service’s Gold Key Service and Single Company Promotion program in seven Chinese cities. The Commercial Service identified local companies interested in purchasing SMC equipment systems and coordinated meetings with key government officials. Dittrich expects significant new sales because of the introductions provided by the Commercial Service. \r\n However, the Commercial Service alone will not ensure success. SMC must continue to build relationships, help customers succeed by finding creative solutions to their problems, and adapt its products and services to meet the needs of a dynamic marketplace. \r\n Dittrich claims that experience in international markets has made him a more effective professional and the company more competitive. “There’s just no doubt that selling overseas has made SMC a more effective exporter and our products more competitive. Our key personnel have grown from the international experience, and we continuously bring ideas back home and apply them throughout the company.” \r\n “Competition is tough in these markets, “Dittrich says, “but that’s where the opportunities are. Exporting is no longer an option, and America’s export future lies in these markets.” \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n For U.S. companies attempting to sell in China, Dittrich has these recommendations: \r\n \r\n  Find good representation. Connections are key, as evidenced in the Chinese expression guanxi, meaning “personal relationship.” \r\n Try to secure payment in advance. Equity stakes can be a problem, given the limitations of the Chinese legal framework and challenges of business transparency, and Americans need to conduct thorough due diligence. \r\n Keep the product simple. The more complex the product, the more things can go wrong. \r\n Talk to your Chinese business partners about taking a long-term perspective. American companies need to make a long-term and sustained commitment to these emerging markets if they are to successfully build lasting relationships.

Kelley’s firm cultivates bacteria that occur naturally, and a special process induces them to eat spilled hydrocarbons at an accelerated rate. “We increased their appetite,” says Kelley. Tierra Dynamic has negotiated the rights to another patented technology that destroys PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls)—a particularly lethal source of carcinogens. \r\n The Challenge \r\n A few years ago, Kelley and his 30 employees set their sights on entering some emerging markets. The move was a matter of common sense. The U.S. environmental industry is very competitive. In contrast, Kelley says, “The environmental industry is new to many developing countries, and we can compete better over there than we can in more developed countries.” He explains that competitors with similar technologies tend to be bigger firms for which a US$300,000 contract isn’t worth the effort. “There’s a big void in the market, and we’re happy to fill it.” But Tierra needed guidance. \r\n  Dan Kelley and His Firm, Tierra  Dynamic, Help Clean Up Toxins \r\n The Solution \r\n With help from the U.S. Commercial Service, Kelley’s international business has gone from nothing to 25 percent of annual revenues. In the process, his key assumptions about the viability of developing markets were challenged. \r\n Tierra Dynamic began its international business in Latin America and Southeast Asia in the late 1990s. Those markets were booming at the time but soon experienced recession and currency devaluation. Business, which began well, evaporated not only because of economic conditions but also because countries in those regions lacked laws requiring companies to clean up their environmental messes and lacked the basic infrastructure that needed cleaning, such as sewage systems. \r\n Faced with an unacceptable level of uncertainty, Kelley headed to Western Europe, where the legal system recognizes third-party liability for environmental damage. He participated in a Commercial Service trade mission to Italy and Spain. Encouraged by interest expressed by potential partners and purchasers, Kelley later returned to Italy to participate in a trade show and to close some deals. “The Commercial Service in Milan found the partners for us,” says Kelley. “We couldn’t have done it without them.” In fact, he adds, “Our success internationally over the past 10 years is a direct result of the substantial help provided by the Commercial Service.” \r\n Kelley says Tierra has signed one contract worth $1 million and is negotiating another of similar value. The company will do soil and water remediation at a solvent plant and a pharmaceutical factory. Those projects, which are expected to be long term, will add 10 percent to the company’s total revenue for the year. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Kelley has this advice to other U.S. businesses contemplating entering international markets: \r\n \r\n  Spread the risk. Kelley learned it’s best to have a presence in dissimilar markets. Then, if one goes south, the other may not. \r\n Look at lower-risk options in higher-risk markets. In Argentina, Tierra Dynamic lowered its risks by doing business with an international development bank. \r\n Don’t rule out a market by assuming it is mature. It may not be as competitive as you think. “Ultimately, we found ourselves doing very good business in Italy,” Kelley says. \r\n Focus in one core area rather than try to deliver different services in different markets.“We were trying to do air pollution monitoring in Singapore, water systems management in Malta, and something else in Argentina,” Kelley explains. “Now we do the one thing we do best—site remediation services.” \r\n Find a good partner. Your partner will go through the rigmarole of helping find clients,” Kelley advises, “and this will greatly accelerate market entry.” \r\n Respect your customer. Kelley notes, “You can never go wrong by showing a client too much respect—even if it means wearing a suit and tie … on an impossibly hot summer afternoon in some dusty place.” \r\n Adapt to the culture. “We Americans like to cut to the chase in business,” Kelley observes. “Other cultures like to orate more than we do, and only eventually get around to what they want.” \r\n Be patient. Kelley believes that “Americans think in quarters. If nothing happens in three months, ‘I’m out of here.’ You need to invest some money and time developing new markets.” \r\n Enjoy the intangible benefits. “International work experience has allowed me to live and work on six continents, among diverse cultures,” Kelley says. “I’ve learned five languages and developed a worldview that no educational training could ever provide. It has given me a sense of self and a self-confidence that have served me very well in the business world, allowing me to develop a keen insight into the commonality of man.” \r\n  \r\n In his travels, Kelley found that “‘Made in the USA’ means everything. It means the best.” But more motivates Tierra Dynamic than pride of place and any competitive advantage associated with it. “This is an idealistic business. At the end of the day, I want to say I got this paycheck for doing something good for somebody else.” \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

Account for tariff rates when pricing your product. \r\n Shipping Your Product \r\n Research information on shipping, logistics, required documentation, and service providers that can help facilitate getting your products to port and through foreign customs. \r\n Note that a Shippers Export Declaration is not required for \"intangible exports of software and technology, such as downloaded software and technical data (i.e., software delivered electronically), including technology and software that requires an export license and mass market software exported electronically.\" This is true regardless of value. \r\n Export License Requirements \r\n Most export transactions do not require specific approval from the U.S. Government. The Department of Commerce has jurisdiction over \"dual use\" exports (commercial items which could have military applications) as well as purely commercial items.

Parties entering an international contract can consider alternative methods of resolving disputes outside of the courtroom. These methods, which are generally known as Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), offer neutral mechanisms for resolving disputes that may arise and can include arbitration, conciliation and mediation. \r\n Arbitration \r\n Arbitration is a primary form of ADR by which the parties agree to submit their disputes to an arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators. Arbitrators have binding authority to render awards that are enforceable in the courts of most countries. Arbitration is often less costly, less litigious, and less time-consuming, and offers more privacy to the parties than litigation. \r\n The parties agree to arbitration in the event of a dispute in the contracting stage by including an arbitration clause in their contract. Depending on what the parties have agreed to, either the parties will choose their own arbitrators and procedures (ad hoc arbitration) or submit their dispute to an arbitral institution. \r\n There are many different arbitral institutions to which parties may turn in the event of a dispute. A number of regional institutions as well as additional information on arbitration may be found with the Office of the General Counsel. \r\n Mediation and Conciliation \r\n Mediation, also known as conciliation, is a process in which parties to a dispute appoint a neutral third party to assist them in resolving their disputes. Unlike a judge or an arbitrator, the mediator does not have the power to compel the parties to accept a recommended solution. The goal of mediation is a voluntary negotiated settlement. \r\n Informal Assistance \r\n Depending on the dispute, the U.S. Embassy or consulate offices may be contacted to attempt to assist the parties in resolving their disputes. \r\n The U.S. Government may provide informal assistance in resolving trade disputes arising between American and foreign businesses at the request of either party. Such assistance is limited to informal, conciliatory efforts directed toward removing misunderstandings between the businesses concerned so that they may settle their differences through friendly relations. \r\n The U.S. Government cannot adjudicate, arbitrate, mediate or provide any kind of ADD to parties in trade disputes. \r\n Additional Resources \r\n Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce \r\n The Commerce Department's Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce has posted useful background information on its website. Focusing mostly on export and investment issues, this website contains resources on various legal issues facing exporters. \r\n District Export Councils \r\n The national and local District Export Councils (DECs) are organizations of leaders from the local business community, whose knowledge of international business provides a source of professional advice for local firms. Many DEC members are practicing attorneys. For more than 25 years, DECs have served the U.S. by assisting companies in their local communities export. \r\n American Bar Association \r\n Another useful source for legal information is the American Bar Association (ABA). The ABA publishes numerous books on the subject of international business. Some of these publications include guides to the legal aspects of doing business in specific countries and guides to foreign law firms and law groups abroad. \r\n Export Legal Assistance Network \r\n The Export Legal Assistance Network (ELAN) program is a nationwide group of attorneys in private law firms that volunteer to provide an initial legal consultation free of charge to companies just beginning to export. Under ELAN, knowledgeable lawyers help new export companies learn the legal aspects of international trade, issues relating to export licensing, domestic and foreign taxation, tariffs, and intellectual property rights are just some of the topics covered.

Navistar and other U.S.-based truck manufacturers faced the possibility of government-imposed trade barriers which involved overly burdensome emission standards that could have blocked access to the Chilean market. \r\n Why it Matters \r\n This ITA action helped preserve the Chilean export market for large trucks, like those manufactured by Navistar, for the foreseeable future. Reducing unnecessary and overly burdensome regulatory barriers is a key issue for transportation companies like Navistar as they continue to leverage the benefits of the U.S -- Chile Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and expand sales in foreign markets. If the United States did not advocate against these trade-restrictive emission standards under the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, Navistar and other American trucks may have become less competitive in Chile. Navistar sold over 1,000 trucks to Chile in 2011, which helped support hundreds of American jobs. This number is likely to grow for 2012. \r\n The Problem \r\n In July 2011, Navistar sought ITA's assistance in confronting a proposed regulation and potential trade barrier in Chile. The Chilean government proposed a regulation that would have established an environmental standard for heavy trucks which could only be met by using an ultra-low sulfur fuel not readily available in Chile. This could have cut Navistar and other U.S. heavy-duty trucks out of the Chilean market. The United States believed that alternative standards were available to meet Chile's need for strong environmental regulation while also reducing the potential to restrict trade. \r\n The Solution \r\n Interventions by ITA and other U.S. government representatives, including the act of raising this issue at the WTO's Technical Barriers to Trade Committee, led Chile to adopt an environmental standard compatible with diesel fuel readily available throughout the country. This solution protects both the environment in Chile and secures market access for heavy-duty trucks in the country. \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, ITA creates, expands, and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas through the Trade Agreements Compliance Program.

Acrow’s modular steel bridges, also known as “Bailey Bridges,” were first developed during World War II with several criteria in mind: that they could be mass produced (utilizing modular steel components); transported easily and rapidly to the site in theatre; constructed quickly (within 24 hours in most cases) using little or no heavy machinery; and erected by soldiers with little or no engineering expertise. As soldiers liberated the European theatre, they built thousands of these Bailey Bridges, shortening World War II by up to two years by some historical estimates. \r\n These bridges have evolved since then in both quality of design and flexibility of application. Today Acrow’s modular steel bridges are galvanized, lasting 75 years and beyond. In addition, most of Acrow’s business is within the civil sector, providing infrastructure solutions for the following applications: highways; rural and feeder roads; emergencies, railroads; mining; bypass bridging; pedestrian crossings; and many more. Acrow’s bridging solutions augment the infrastructure portfolios in the countries they serve, improving access to schools, hospitals, and greater economic opportunity. \r\n Says Paul Sullivan, Acrow’s international sales manager: “Most of our work takes place in the developing world. Many of these countries have tremendous amounts of human capital that remains underserved due to a severe lack of transportation infrastructure. For instance within Africa, outside a 30-mile area around a coast or major city, it can be incredibly challenging to travel to or from the interior. This has a particularly strong impact on the agricultural sector, where farmers attempting to bring perishable crops to market find long delays due to poor infrastructure a major obstacle to their economic viability. By improving infrastructure, we also improve access to main economic arteries, a necessity for any long-term sustainable economic development,” said Sullivan. \r\n \r\n Bridge by Acrow Corporation \r\n The Challenge \r\n Since it first began exporting years ago, Acrow has faced many challenges in the international market. For example, in many cases, the firm was looking to develop targeted leads of overseas partners seeking unique bridge technologies to resolve infrastructure issues. In other cases, Acrow was looking to meet key overseas government contacts, resolve roadblocks involving logistics, and navigate overseas government transparency hurdles or other impediments to exporting. For the last ten years, Acrow has successfully tapped export assistance, market briefings, and business matchmaking programs of the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) in Northern New Jersey and around the world, to do just that and more. \r\n For example, when Sullivan was first pursuing the Chilean market, he dialed up the CS in Santiago, Chile, which then provided him with the appropriate introductions to Chilean Army officials. Sullivan then highlighted Acrow’s unique solutions and interest in helping the country recover from a major earthquake with one of the company’s proven emergency bridging solutions. By late June 2010, Acrow confirmed the sale of a $16.3 million, 1.4 kilometer bridge by Acrow to the Chilean Ministry of Defense, which was built in 81 days, reconnecting traffic flow over the Rio Bio Bio River in Concepcion, Chile’s second largest city. Earlier, in September 2009, Acrow had sought CS El Salvador guidance in selling bridges to the Salvadoran government. Shortly thereafter, Hurricane Ida hit El Salvador, destroying 45 bridges. The U.S. Government conducted an assessment of the bridges and infrastructure damage, and made recommendations for repair and replacement. With help from the CS, Acrow’s Bailey Bridges were recommended as part of the solution. As a result, El Salvador’s Ministry of Public Works confirmed that it signed a $14.5 million contract with Acrow for the purchase of over 3 dozen bridges. \r\n The Result \r\n To date, Acrow has agents in many countries as a direct result of CS business matchmaking assistance. Acrow’s aggressive and savvy export strategies, backed by ongoing CS assistance, have enabled the firm to succeed in a tough economic climate. \r\n Although the recession started in 2007, thanks to Acrow’s exports, the company has grown over 400 percent. Developing countries have been highly interested in the infrastructure upgrades as a cornerstone to sustainable economic development, particularly investments in roads and bridges. Such massive investment has led to Acrow’s modular steel bridges becoming a “hot product” around the globe. While some companies remain nervous of exporting, Acrow Corporation believes it’s the only way to go. \r\n Exporting to over 60 countries worldwide, Acrow’s international success has affected both the United States’ domestic economy along with international markets and living conditions. In 2010-11, Acrow exported 100 bridges to Ghana, 151 to Angola, 36 to El Salvador, 20 to Mexico, and 24 to Peru. Such big ticket projects not only benefit the end-user, but also allow Acrow to directly add and maintain approximately 200 jobs in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \r\n “Beyond our own factory, we also only use U.S. Steel, known to be the highest quality steel in the world, which indirectly affects steel mill workers throughout the United States,” says Sullivan. “Now when delegations from other countries visit our Milton, Pennsylvania factory, our workers are the first to shake their hands. Many employees have friends who have lost their jobs, but thanks to our export program Acrow has undergone massive hiring in the past four years.” \r\n Export Tips from Paul Sullivan \r\n Rather than worrying about the risks exporting may involve, Sullivan instead advises companies to look beyond the borders of the United States. “As long as you know your product and company, and have the intellectual curiosity and interest in genuinely learning the market and culture of the countries in which you hope to have success, you can excel in international trade,” says Sullivan. “Taking that extra step and truly involving yourself in the new culture will certainly help you succeed, and the results will be good for everyone-customer and supplier.” \r\n “Making local connections is imperative in every country. In fact, most countries require a company to have local representation, such as an agent, distributor, lawyer or other representative. We have partners in almost all the countries we do business with.” \r\n Acrow’s export business model is founded on the principle of intellectual curiosity, meaning that the company works hard to outwardly embrace the culture of each customer. For instance, Acrow representatives take the time to get to know the individuals. “It’s important to have a human touch when working outside of the United States; in many markets it is vital to develop a personal relationship prior to any attempt at discussing business,” Sullivan says.

Ganache for Lips quickly expanded to sell multiple kinds of balm in Japan, Germany, Australia, Spain, Canada, Taiwan and the Philippines. Her Japanese distributor then introduced the product to South Korea, but he and West soon became baffled by that government’s import regulations. West went back to the Commercial Service in San Francisco who contacted colleagues in Seoul who spelled out what was required, opening the market to West.

Based in Louisville, Kentucky, the firm also has manufacturing facilities in Indiana. CEO Steve McMenamin spent 20 years in luxury sales and design before he was inspired to start the company. As a former employee of Porsche Design, he wanted to find a better material than plastic to create bold eyewear styles, with a more comfortable fit. The company obtains its unique sustainable wood from local wood laminators who furnish cabin interiors for business jets. These include zebrawood, bamboo, bubinga, and Makassar ebony. iWood uses smaller portions of wood that the companies are unable to use, but work perfectly for sunglasses. The result? Sunglasses that are stronger and lighter than plastic and resist breaking, with the option for polarized or prescription lenses. \r\n \r\n iWood Sunglasses \r\n The Challenge \r\n With eco-friendly fashion a growing trend worldwide, iWood Eco Design was confident of its great sales potential. “I see a trend of ‘greenwashing,’ with many products on the market claiming to be ‘eco’ yet they are not,” said McMenamin. “That’s where we have a competitive edge, our products are Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified, harvested by sustainable methods, and use glue and protective coating that are formaldehyde free and emit no VOCs.” \r\n While export prospects looked good, the company had never sold internationally before, and first needed to identify markets with strong demand for sustainable eco-friendly fashion. McMenamin also wanted to establish the brand and finding reputable buyers who could help him set up successful distributorships. He contacted the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) office in Indianapolis to discuss identifying foreign markets and finding events in which to meet international buyers. \r\n CS Indiana helped iWood identify the Premiere Classe Show in Paris, France, as an ideal venue to display its products and establish an international presence in the fashion market. The show features top designers who influence purchasing designers and exclusive international distributors, and represents a major event in the fashion industry. However, this particular trade show is very exclusive and is difficult for smaller, lesser-known companies like iWood to receive an invitation. \r\n The Solution \r\n CS Indiana contacted the CS office in Paris to ensure iWood received an invitation to the Premiere Class Show. Additionally, the CS Indiana Director wrote a letter of support on behalf of iWood that enabled it to quality for the Trade Show Assistance Program, which provides financial assistance for small Indiana businesses to participate in International Trade Shows. CS Paris promoted iWood’s prior to the show by contacting fashion designers such as Louis Vuitton and Hermes. As a result of the show, McMenamin secured deals with Les Galeries Lafayette of France, and House of Fraser, a company with 62 stores in the UK. After the show, iWood continued to receive orders from throughout Europe, as well as Russia, Australia, and the Middle East. “I was excited that our product had even stronger potential in Europe than in the United States,” said McMenamin. “CS Indiana worked with us all the way, providing counseling on European Union tariffs and taxes, distribution methods, and providing market intelligence. Now, the majority of our sales are international and we expect tremendous growth in international sales.” \r\n iWood Eco Design has since shipped to boutiques in France, UK, Russia, New Zealand, Australia, China, Canada, Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark, and others. The firm is frequently featured in international magazines, including Vogue, Elle, Marie Claire, and Cosmopolitan, and is currently setting up distribution with agents in Seoul and Paris. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Attending a trade show and meeting face to face with international partners was key for iWood Eco Design. In addition to many leads, the company increased the visibility of its brand to buyers, and identified fashion and eco conscious markets. McMenamin found that Germany, Japan and Korea were especially eco-friendly. \r\n McMenamin recommends that other small companies consider exporting. “Exporting has provided us with a steady stream of business through the economic downturn,” he says. Building on the success of its eyewear, McMenamin says the firm is planning on moving into more markets to include not only eyewear, but a new accessories collection made from scrap eyewear pieces to include earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and cocktail rings. \r\n McMenamin states, “The Commercial Service Indianapolis office has been instrumental in providing us with information and support for our exporting efforts. They are always available and have provided immediate solutions to any problems in the exporting process.” \r\n \r\n iWood Necklaces \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Attend a trade show. Attending the Premiere Class Show in France was the impetus of iWood’s international success. If you are unable to attend a trade show abroad, consider attending a International Buyer Program Show, which bring foreign buyers to the U.S. \r\n Identify which markets are a match for your company. iWood found demand worldwide, but identified key consumer markets in countries such as Germany and Japan that had high interest in eco-fashion. \r\n Get to know your local U.S. Commercial Service office. We coordinate with our CS offices worldwide and help connect you with many other resources. \r\n  ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Success Story: iWood Eco Design","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Consumer Goods \u0026 Home Furnishings"],"topic":["Trade Counseling"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"176","content":" The Company \r\n Macron Dynamics of Croydon, Pennsylvania, is a manufacturer of linear motion control products, actuators, and systems, ranging from basic assemblies to complete robotic automation systems. For more than 20 years, Macron actuators and robotic systems have been used around the world in some of the most unusual environments. \r\n Product applications include robotics for pharmaceutical packaging machinery, high speed drum printers, welding stations, mail handling automation, television broadcasting hardware, defense naval applications, vending machines, and mechanisms at amusement parks. As the company describes it, “often unseen, our products are in the places you go, inside the machines that make the things you use and the food you eat.” \r\n The Success \r\n For many years, Macron conducted business in Canada through a sole distributor of its products. “Canada was an easy country to establish our export business due to the North American Free Trade Agreement,” said Craig Marshall, Executive Vice President. By 2009, however, the company was focusing on expanding its international portfolio, and contacted the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) office in Philadelphia for help in tapping new global sales opportunities. CS staff encouraged the company to participate in the Trade Winds Business Development Mission to Brazil in 2010. The CS-organized event offered Macron representatives the opportunity to meet with commercial officers from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, who offered insight into their countries’ markets for Macron products. “Attending Trade Winds and speaking to the commercial officers helped us figure out where Macron would be most successful,” states Marshall. \r\n With help from the CS Philadelphia office, Macron utilized the Gold Key Matchmaking Service, part of Trade Winds – Mexico City 2011, to meet with prescreened distributors and identify a selling agent for Macron products in Mexico. Since 2009, the company has received ongoing CS support to identify distribution channels and selling agents in India, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico, and to qualify customers who contact the company unsolicited through the Internet. \r\n The Result \r\n With assistance from the CS and the company’s perseverance, Macron Dynamics’ exports grew by 31 percent from 2009 to 2010. “We have seen an increase in export activity to countries on almost every continent, and despite the troubled economy, we’ve seen our sales double over the past two years,” said Marshall. \r\n In April 2011, Macron representatives once again attended the Trade Winds Forum, this time held in Mexico City, Mexico. During the event, the company was presented with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Achievement Certificate by Carlos Pascual, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. \r\n “It was an honor to receive the award and gratifying to be recognized for our hard work building our export business over these last two years,” said Marshall. “Mexico has served as our partner in introducing Macron to other South American markets, and we will continue to be aggressive in our international sales efforts with help from the U.S. Commercial Service.” \r\n \r\n Macron Dynamics Receives Export Achievement Certificate \r\n from Carlos Pascual, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico in 2011. \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Find out more about U.S. Commercial Service events. Macron Dynamics attended Trade Winds, which enabled them to meet the Senior Commercial Officers from multiple countries. Browse a list of upcoming events. \r\n Contact your local CS office. Find an office in your area and learn more about events going on locally in your area. \r\n Not ready to travel abroad yet? Learn more about foreign markets by participating in a webinar, or using our market research. \r\n  ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Success Story: Macron Dynamics of Pennsylvania","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Construction Building \u0026 Heavy Equipment"],"topic":[],"subtopic":["Business Matchmaking"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"171","content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n Under Secretary Padilla, Eddie O'Donnell of  Powerscreen, and Carolyn Tandy \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Powerscreen Receives Assistance and Award from the Department of Commerce \r\n Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Powerscreen Sales and Rentals are official suppliers of a multitude of global markets - from mining, quarrying and aggregate extraction to construction and demolition waste recycling. \r\n In early 2008 TS Mona Musa and UPS Account Executive Dean Johnson jointly counseled Edwards O’Donnell on a shipment held at Venezuelan Customs. The buyer had concerns about the duties and taxes required to release the equipment ordered. TS Musa promptly got O’Donnell in contact with the Trade Information Center to identify the corresponding HS number and applicable taxes. According to this information, the shipment should have incurred about 22% in VAT- which is significantly less than the amount being charged. TIC specialist Randy Mye also added that the importer probably needed to be pre-approved for importation through “Cadivi” , a foreign exchange body in Venezuela before the Funds could be transferred back to the USA. \r\n This information enabled O’Donnell to manage expectations of his Venezuelan buyers and provide them with the expected taxes applicable at time of import. This shipment was finally released from customs and O’Donnell adds that knowing this information has enabled them to cut shipping time from 46 days down to 9 days. Powerscreen has made 2 additional shipments to Venezuela since receiving this information and look forward to significant growth in Latin American markets. \r\n With its network of offices across the United States and in more than 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration utilizes its global presence and international marketing expertise to help U.S. companies sell their products and services worldwide.

But these aren’t ordinary skylights. They employ patented technologies that bring more natural light in, and they come with optional kits that convert the skylight into a light fixture as the natural light fades or into a ventilator for kitchen and bathroom use. As the price of electricity increases, skylights for both home and commercial use save money and are good for the environment. \r\n The Challenge \r\n Solatube was founded in Australia in 1995. Its directors disagreed on whether going international was the best direction for the company, but in the end they elected to give it a try. They then decamped for California to be closer to the U.S. domestic market and to Europe and Latin America. According to International Sales Vice President Brett Hanley, “A smaller company like ours can’t be experts in every market. We’re not that stupid to think we can do it all.” \r\n Solatube also needed a way to insulate itself from the bottom end of the business cycle in its new home market. “We needed to find entrepreneurial folks overseas who can find the people working on the roofs. We need national distributors with business backgrounds who can set up everything for us,” says Hanley. \r\n The Solution \r\n At first Solatube was mostly passive in its outreach, meeting potential distributors at trade shows or evaluating prospects who contacted Solatube through the Web or by phone. Results were very mixed, and the company spent more time on unfocused searching than on selling and growing the business. \r\n \r\n Solatube builds unique skylights  which can also serve as light fixtures. \r\n So Solatube approached the U.S. Commercial Service’s Export Assistance Center in San Diego. “We did things the hard way for a number of years until we met the Commercial Service. We wished we had met them before,” says Hanley. \r\n Trade Specialist Julia Rauner Guerrero entered the picture as Solatube set its sights on France. With help from her colleague Eva Prevost in Marseille, Guerrero identified a number of master distributor prospects, including one who had seen Solatube promoted on the U.S. Commercial Web site in France (www.buyusa.gov/france). In the end, Solatube chose this distributor to represent the product line. Everything was wrapped up in less than six months, and orders were placed for $100,000 worth of product. \r\n Guerrero says, “We encouraged Solatube to develop a regional sales strategy in France and helped develop that strategy. They also followed our advice to engage a French-speaking staff person at their San Diego office, as language was going to be a barrier in developing their business further.” \r\n Thanks to the Commercial Service, Solatube is now selling over 160,000 units per year in 36 different overseas markets. International sales have surpassed 15 percent of total sales with no ceiling in sight for the company’s skylights, which are brightening homes and businesses from London to Mexico. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n According to Doug Barry of the U.S. Commercial Service and editor of A Basic Guide to Exporting from which this case study comes, Solatube’s number one lesson learned was that small companies can expand internationally, gain significant new sales, and add jobs. \r\n Don’t try to do it all yourself, says Hanley. It’s easy to get overstretched and to waste valuable time. “There is a lot of excellent free and low-cost help out there, including that of the U.S. government and its partners,” he advises. “In the case of France, our Commercial Service contact there served as a filter for us. The French distributor would talk to Eva as both our representative there and as a representative of the U.S. government, and she would interpret things for us. There was a French-to-French thing going there that worked out great for us.” \r\n The most important thing you can do is to find good distributors in your target markets. You can spend lots of time and money finding them on your own, but Hanley offers this recommendation: “Let the government do it for you. This is their niche and they’re the best at it.” \r\n Hanley is a strong advocate of diversification: “Diversifying economic risks really does work. When it’s sunny in some of our markets, it’s snowing in others. When business is down in the States, it’s up somewhere else. Our overseas sales have been growing 41percent a year for the past six years. We now enjoy a benefit of 26 to 20 percent against the euro in the Euro Zone. We then put some of this back into marketing.” \r\n Moreover, Hanley says, “Our international success has improved our acquisition profile. Not that we’re looking to sell, but if we ever are in the future we’ll be worth a lot more because of the international dimension of our business.” \r\n Navigating cultural issues with distributors can be a challenge. Don’t be reluctant to ask for help. “In one instance,” says Hanley, “After we agreed on a deal, we sent a contract to a distributor unsigned by us. The distributor was very upset, believing we didn’t trust him. This would be unthinkable in his culture. There was no legal risk for us to sign it, so the reason we didn’t was probably cultural.” Knowing how not to unintentionally give offense is an important and easily learnable business skill. \r\n Exporting has made Solatube’s domestic business stronger also. Hanley explains, “Experience in Europe and elsewhere in the world has turned us into something of a thought leader in our U.S. business dealings.” Environmental practices in commercial buildings are sometimes more advanced in Europe than in the United States. Solatube has brought those ideas back to the United States and had them adopted by its U.S. customers. “It gives us a competitive advantage,” Hanley says. “Also the U.S. companies we do work for overseas are eager to use us here in the United States. The international work gives us credibility.” \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Use Web-based channels to reach out to prospective distributors. Your company’s Web site is a good way to troll for new business. Even though English is understood widely in the global business world, it’s often helpful to translate your product information into the language of the market you are entering. Contact a professional translation company to help ensure that the translation is accurate. \r\n Consider using the Featured U.S. Exporter service. Solatube used this service to find its French distributor. The service is highly targeted, and U.S. companies pay only for the cost of translating their materials. A link to your e-mail account is included. For more information visitwww.buyusa.gov. \r\n Learn about the culture of your target markets. Selling consumer items to Canada may require no more cultural knowledge than how to use a phone book. Selling to Paris or Pakistan, however, may not be the same. There are many good books on doing business in different cultures, and a quick visit to your local public library will be time well spent. Cultural information is also available through consultants and your local Export Assistance Center of the U.S. Commercial Service. \r\n  \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

Companies should consider and evaluate the advantages of advertising online as an extension and component of their corporate growth strategies and as part of their international marketing efforts. Advertising messages often appear on portals or other websites that draw viewers with content (news, information) and services (such as email, chat, forums, etc.). Companies may seek to advertise on search engines that attract high traffic volume (e.g., Yahoo!) or target a specialized demographic (e.g., ivillage ). Some portals sell favorable link positioning or advertising keyed to particular search terms in a user query (e.g., Overture). Companies may also consider using an advertising network that feeds ads to a network of sites, thereby enabling large marketing campaigns (e.g, Doubleclick). (Note that all the websites listed above have been internationalized or have local mirror sites.) \r\n Direct E-mail \r\n Direct e-mail may be a good way to promote web presence, depending on the market, product, or service. Direct e-mail is an inexpensive way to reach thousands of potential customers. However, several countries have legislation prohibiting or restricting unsolicited commercial email (see the International Telecommunication Union website at International Telecommunication Union for more information on international spam legislation), and certainly any email must not constitute fraud. The Direct Marketing Association suggests that any email marketing should have: \r\n  An honest subject line \r\n No use of forged headers or deceptive technology \r\n The identity of the sender, which includes a \"physical\" address \r\n An opt-out that is easy to find and easy to use (Note: Some countries may specify an opt-in approach. To ensure compliance, research spam legislation for each country you are targeting. \r\n  Whether you're targeting domestic or international customers, before choosing direct email as a way to promote your web presence, companies should be aware of the potential for backlash against unsolicited e-mails by consumers who feel overwhelmed by the number of such emails received.

The country of the importer has banned the importation of the particular good. One good example is Singapore. Singapore has an absolute ban on the importation of chewing gum. Other countries have banned the importation of various types of used or refurbished equipment. Goods may also be rejected if they are not properly labeled or marked with required certifications. The best remedy is to conduct proper research in advance of any sales to determine that there are not particular restrictions on your goods that would result in their exclusion from the country of import. For further assistance, use the resources below: \r\n Importer Rejections \r\n Importers may reject goods for a number of reasons. There are typically three origins for these reasons for rejecting goods -- exporter, shipper and the importer. \r\n  \r\n Exporter Origin Reasons: The importer may reject the goods because of mistakes by the exporter. The exporter may have shipped the wrong goods, defective goods or goods that were improperly packaged or labeled. \r\n Remedy: If this is the reason for the rejection, work through a local Export Assistance Center to intervene on your behalf. \r\n Prevention: It is suggested that the company have someone in the company's shipping department dedicated to overseeing all export shipments. This person should be the primary contact to work with the freight forwarding company. With such a strategy these mistakes are more likely to be avoided. \r\n \r\n \r\n Shipper Origin Reasons: Sometimes goods are rejected because they arrive damaged or the goods are significantly delayed in delivery. \r\n Remedy: Unless the goods were in a damaged condition when they were packed, goods damaged during the course of shipment are the responsibility of the shipper. Depending on which INCOTERMS® are designated will determine whose responsibility the loss due to damage is. If risk of loss is still with the exporter, the exporter will need to make arrangements to ship replacement goods. Next step is to contact the freight forwarder to file a claim with the cargo insurance company. If the risk of loss is with the importer the exporter needs to provide the importer with all necessary information to file a claim with the cargo insurance company and make arrangements to ship replacement goods. \r\n Prevention: Minimizing damage during shipment is principally the responsibility of the exporter to make sure that proper crating and packing of the goods done. This is best determined by guidance from the freight forwarder. \r\n \r\n \r\n Importer Origin Reasons: Most importer origin reasons for rejecting the goods generally do not have a valid basis. Reasons may include they changed their mind, ordered the wrong goods or can no longer pay. \r\n Remedy: The key remedy is to assure that arrangements have been made for a secure method of payment. If there is a payment issue then working through the local Export Assistance Center to request trade complaint assistance. \r\n Prevention: The most important step is to conduct proper screening of buyers and partners. \r\n \r\n  Additional Resources \r\n  Common trade problems \r\n Browse the Knowlege Base \r\n Find an Export Assistance Center \r\n Ask a question \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-11","title":"Goods Rejections","update_date":"2013-02-12","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":["Trade Problems"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"218","content":" The International Trade Administration's (ITA) Market Access and Compliance (MAC) Unit recently supported Diebold, a Canton, Ohio-based manufacturer of automated teller machines (ATMs), in its efforts to overcome an unfair cost of doing business in India's IT sector. \r\n Why it matters: Though India had committed to provide duty free access to certain IT products, including ATMs, its decision not to classify Diebold's machines as ATMs subjected Diebold to a 30 percent duty. This significantly raised the cost of Diebold’s exports and undermined their competitiveness in the Indian market. \r\n \r\n The problem: Indian Customs authorities refused to classify Diebold’s machines as ATMs because the machines did not accept deposits, thus depriving Diebold of the benefits of duty-free treatment to which India had previously agreed under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Information Technology Agreement. \r\n The solution: MAC, in cooperation with other U.S. Government agencies, placed sustained pressure on the Indian Commerce and Finance Ministries to reclassify Diebold’s machines appropriately as ATMs. As a result, India finally reclassified Diebold’s machines, reducing the tariff’s Diebold owed from 30% to zero, and ensuring its continued duty-free access to the $100+ million market for the company in India. \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas.

Successful resolution of this issue avoided a potential precedent that could have affected other American construction firms' ability to operate in the Japanese market. \r\n The Problem: The Japanese government asked the California-based construction firm to produce a U.S. government-backed certificate confirming the legal/mental competence of the firm's board of directors before the GOJ would renew its construction license. Without the license, the firm was told that it could not operate in Japan. The requirement raised questions under the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules about unfairly disqualifying qualified bidders. \r\n The Solution: ITA specialists determined that the Japanese requirement may have been inconsistent with existing WTO rules and bilateral trade arrangements. Rather than utilizing the often costly and time consuming formal WTO mechanisms, MAC leveraged its deep relationship with the Japanese Government. The ITA team explained how the U.S. legal system differs from Japan's and confirmed that the United States does not issue the kind of certificates being requested. The Japanese Government has since waived the requirement for this certificate.

The company has been around since 1979 and employs approximately 50 people. ATCi has been serving a wide variety of industries including Cable TV, broadcast \u0026amp; media, TV-Radio, telecommunications, teleports, government-the military in particular-as well as Fortune 500 corporate businesses with its antennas, fiber optics and digital headend turn key solutions. \r\n Due to the global nature of the satellite industry, ATCi naturally found its way into exporting.

Bjerk knows the importance of good international relationships and has knowledge of the biggest challenges in international business. \r\n Prior to 2002, ATCi did not have a dedicated international sales staff. The company's international sales often resulted from orders from other U.S. companies that were destined for export or from the occasional lead received at trade shows. But with the opening of a division specifically dedicated to international sales, ATCi needed to learn to direct its satellite offerings toward new global markets. Working with the U.S. Commercial Service, ATCi has participated in many different programs to help increase international sales, including teleconferencing, the Gold Key Matching Service, international seminars, catalog shows. These programs facilitated meetings with numerous international delegates, potential resellers, agents and distributors, which eventually led to partnerships.

Does your fast-paced lifestyle require lots of “spring in your step?” Then maybe you could use some nutritional supplements. Certified Worldwide LLC (CW) has made health and nutrition its business. Hal Selim, director of business development for CW, says his company’s success doesn’t just hinge on the more than 10,000 products and 500 lines of over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, supplements, and sports nutrition; it also depends on great worldwide customer service. \r\n Located in Moorpark, California, CW started in 1999 with sales to distributors and to on-line customers in the United States through its e-commerce Web site www.medicalprovisions.com. The company then began to pursue international opportunities by identifying overseas distributors who could help streamline the selling process abroad. “We recognized that by not exporting, we were not tapping our full sales potential—sort of like leaving money on the table,” says Selim. \r\n  Hal Selim of Certified Worldwide LLC \r\n The Challenge \r\n Equipped with freight forwarders and potential overseas buyers, Selim focused his attention on making export sales a reality. He soon began learning the ins and outs of import regulations for foreign countries and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) export certification issues, such as obtaining the health certificates that many foreign countries require for health-related products. Addressing these issues was key to navigating the export process and avoiding unnecessary costs and delays. \r\n Selling health-related products in the international market also requires extensive market and economic research. Each market has its own consumer tastes and ways of doing business. For example, in Asia, people might want joint pain and muscle relief, whereas in other countries, people might have heart-related needs. To supplement his marketing strategy, Selim tracked down specific information on health industries in Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, and other regions. \r\n “When you think about the documentation required and other areas where we needed assistance, it was sort of daunting as to where we would begin,” Selim says. “But we knew through our business acquaintances that we could count on the U.S. Commercial Service to help.” \r\n The Solution \r\n During his initial meeting with Selim, Gerald Vaughn, director of the U.S. Export Assistance Center in Ventura, set up a plan to assist CW. First, Vaughn contacted key Commercial Service trade specialists on the Health Care Technologies Team. Tony Michalski and Julieanne Hennessy were familiar with FDA and could connect with the right people. Next, Vaughn gained insight into the FDA approval process. Shortly thereafter, Vaughn contacted the Commercial Service’s health care trade specialists overseas and discussed certificate issues, thus laying the foundation for obtaining the required health documents. Vaughn then introduced Selim to the Commercial Service’s Country Commercial Guides, which provide detailed market research on different industries and countries. \r\n “Without the experience and on-the-ground support of the U.S. Commercial Service, we would not have surpassed the export challenges that we met early on when we began exporting,” Selim says. “Had we tried this on our own, we would not be as well positioned in international markets as we are today.” \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Early on, CW learned that the best way to build a good business is to get background information on potential distributors beforehand, said Doug Barry, editor of A Basic Guide to Exporting from which this case study is taken. CW receives payment up front in the form of bank wire transfer or letter of credit. A typical scenario is to receive a 30 percent deposit when the customer places the order and the remaining 70 percent balance before shipping the order. “Getting paid is a key part to running a business, and unless a company has the right payment policies in place, that company is more likely to be subjected to payment scams,” says Selim. \r\n CW also learned that the cost of freight can make or break a deal. Selim has worked extensively on building key relationships with freight forwarders. His efforts have resulted in great air and ocean rates for customers. CW’s freight forwarders that can ship almost anywhere a customer needs. “Seek out your local Commercial Service office and find a freight forwarder, interview different freight forwarders, and remember that the company chosen will be responsible for shipping your product,” says Selim. Airlines are a great source for freight forwarders. Their cargo departments work directly with freight forwarders and can recommend which ones to use for the product line. “Also,” Selim advises, “depending on the size of the shipment, freight damage and theft insurance is vital.” \r\n The more business you give your freight forwarder, the more valuable you become. As shipments grow, you can set up agreements to obtain better rates. Also, you can shop for competitive rates. If you find a better rate than what you already have, see if your freight forwarder can match it. Your customer overseas may also be able to find a better rate. “The better the rate, the better the savings for your customer, which translates into more business in the future,” says Selim. \r\n Selim says the following elements are crucial in an export operation: \r\n \r\n  Large selection of competitively priced products \r\n Fresh products with a long expiration date \r\n Continuous promotions and discounts \r\n Competitive freight charges \r\n Quick lead time for shipments \r\n Thorough product inspection before shipping \r\n Quick response to customer demands for additional documentation \r\n Quick response to new customer inquiries and follow-up after delivery \r\n  \r\n Feasibility studies are vital as you develop overseas markets. When conducting the study, address factors such as market size, market growth, accessibility, competition, business practices, and economic stability. Exporting overseas has introduced CW to many different cultures, business practices, and legal systems. Such experience has made CW’s management team more flexible and creative. \r\n Action \r\n Are you ready to promote your product or service in other countries? Here are some tips: \r\n \r\n  Talk to the U.S. Commercial Service. Make your nearest U.S. Export Assistance Center the first stop on your road to export success. The Commercial Service offers market entry strategies, export counseling, market research, and much more. \r\n Build rapport with your customers. Smaller orders will build rapport and give you a feel for the market. Orders will increase as your company progresses. \r\n Participate in trade shows. Trade shows are one of the best ways to generate trade leads. “Walk the show floor and observe exhibitors and buyers—and after attending a few shows, you might be ready to set up an exhibit of your own and pursue new market opportunities,” Selim advises. \r\n Take advantage of seminars. Selim says that seminars are where businesses can learn the rules, regulations, and policies associated with export controls, financing, customs, and other issues. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n The U.

The company’s power generation systems and technologies promote fuel usage efficiency, reduce pollution, and reduce waste streams by using them as fuel sources. CAI’s focus is on underserved markets, where rapid electrification projects are a top priority to help national advance in jobs, sanitation, and improvements in quality of life. An important aspect of CAI’s power generation equipment is that to the greatest extent possible, they use U.S.-made components. The gas turbines are from major U.S. suppliers, gearboxes are sourced from Texas, generators are made in Ohio, and skids and enclosures for the units are U.S. sourced steel. The systems are built and integrated in CAI’s own manufacturing plant in California.

In 2007, with CS assistance, the company won a tender with the Government of Benin for dual-fired gas turbines of 80 MW capacity to address the country’s increasingly dire energy shortages and related electricity power cuts. CS staff in California worked with the Advocacy Center and the U.S. Embassy in Benin to set up a series of meetings with Benin’s President Boni Yayi, the Ministers of Finance and Energy, and the Counselor to the President on Energy Affairs. CAI was awarded a multi-million dollar bid. \r\n Since 2007, CAI has continued to expand into new markets abroad, including Turkey and Europe.

The Government of Bahrain (GOB) claimed that because the motorcycles were not imported directly into Bahrain from the United States and instead were transshipped (shipped through a third country), they therefore did not fulfill the FTA’s rules of origin which would grant Harley-Davidson duty-free access. \r\n   \r\n The Solution: A team of ITA specialists and representatives from other USG agencies advocated on behalf of Harley-Davidson and provided specific guidance on the FTA rules of origin for transshipped goods which resulted in the GOB allowing for transshipment stop-overs. In addition, MAC and representatives from U.S. Customs and Border Protection provided training to Bahrain customs officers. Due to these efforts, Harley-Davidson was granted duty-free access and has received a refund of all duties paid from the Government of Bahrain. This solution will also benefit other U.S. exporters to Bahrain who transship their products. \r\n   \r\n Working closely with U.S. companies, MAC creates, expands and defends market access for U.S. goods and services overseas. “We promote policy that develops a more favorable business climate for U.S. companies in global markets; we employ commercial diplomacy to resolve trade barriers; and we leverage our bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to ensure our trading partners live up to their commitments so that our businesses can compete on a level-playing field.” - Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance, Michael C.

Now, as chief executive officer of JQ American in Hayward, California, Qureshi is tapping the lucrative world market as an exporter of products and services in the energy, medical, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries. Qureshi, who immigrated to the United States years ago, recently came full circle and has just started doing business in the city where he was born. \r\n About a year ago, while attending a high school reunion in his native city of Bhopal, India, Qureshi learned that the Bhopal Medical College Trust wanted to outfit its soon-to-be-built medical training hospital with equipment using some of the latest U.S. medical technologies. For Qureshi, helping the citizens of his old hometown would turn into the opportunity of a lifetime. \r\n Selling internationally wasn’t new to Qureshi. He already had a solid record of export successes. He sold to 16 countries—including a contract with the United Nations in Kosovo to outfit a hospital with medical supplies and sales of medical and laboratory equipment to Iraq and its Ministry of Health. JQ American is unusual because most U.S. small and medium-size firms that export do so to only one international market. \r\n  Jamal Qureshi, CEO of JQ American \r\n The Challenge \r\n Looking at India, Qureshi knew that financing was key to making the deal happen. India, like many countries, does not have a tradition of credit cards or other forms of advance payment. Purchasers want terms—often 45 days—and sellers from competitor countries are ready to grant them. Qureshi, however, does not usually have a cash flow sufficient to meet the buyers’ demand for expensive imaging and other devices. Would the schmoozing with high school pals and the chance to do some good (and some good business) in his old stomping grounds come to naught? \r\n The Solution \r\n Over several months, Qureshi, with help from the U.S. Commercial Service in Oakland, California, arranged key meetings through videoconference and phone calls with the Bank of Alameda (California), the U.S. Export–Import (Exim) Bank, the State Bank of India, and the Bhopal Medical College Trust. These efforts enabled Qureshi to obtain an Exim Bank letter of interest and qualify for a subsequent commercial financing loan of $23 million through the Bank of Alameda and State Bank of India. Impressed with JQ American’s reputation and its ability to meet the financial requirements of the project, Bhopal Medical College Trust considered JQ American its top choice for the supplier contract. After months of negotiation, Qureshi finalized the deal during a U.S. Commerce Department trade mission to India. \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Qureshi is aware that he personifies the American Dream, so much so that he made American part of his company name. Given that the markets JQ American works in often proclaim opposition to U.S. foreign policy and values in the form of consumer boycotts and worse, some people might consider the company’s name the kiss of commercial death. \r\n Qureshi doesn’t buy it. “People around the world love our products and services,” he says, directing a doubtful graphic designer to add more American flags to his new logo. “Even with embargoes, they want us. Iranians will shout, ‘Down with America,’ then buy our stuff through third parties.” \r\n Why do American companies have such an advantage? “Because we are world leaders in so many areas, but especially in setting high quality standards,” Qureshi says. “In other countries, including China, quality varies from region to area and from company to company. My customers will pay more for the ‘Made in America’ label.” \r\n Qureshi’s upbringing in a hardscrabble part of India gave him a certain comfort level for doing business in challenging parts of the world, but he says that the requisite skills can be learned by doing. “Get out in the world and get a feel for what people want and how they do business,” he advises. “The opportunities for growth are tremendous, and the risks are very manageable, thanks to advances in logistics, banking, and market intelligence for the smaller U.S. company.” \r\n One lesson he learned in Kosovo and the Middle East is that it’s important to have reliable locals perform after-sales service. In a new project in the Philippines, where he’s equipping a medical tourism hospital, Qureshi plans to hire and train Filipinos to provide 24/7 maintenance for surgical and other sophisticated devices. “Hospitals are complex places that reflect local cultures,” he explains. “By offering a turnkey solution with local maintenance, I was able to make a very favorable impression.” \r\n The U.S. Commercial Service has helped Qureshi find local equipment maintenance companies in markets around the world. Commercial Service specialists find and vet candidates and help Qureshi make the selection. \r\n Working with U.S. government personnel has other advantages. Qureshi explains, “Showing up at a potential buyer’s with U.S. officials in tow always makes a positive impression—so positive that I now conduct at least one business meeting with potential buyers who visit me in the U.S. at my local federal building. \r\n The Commercial Service helped Qureshi line up financing and facilitate other deals in India during a recent trade mission there. Thanks to U.S. government resources such as Exim Bank, JQ American has lines of credit to finance new export sales and can get additional funds in turnaround times of five days or less. \r\n Access to credit and government expertise transformed JQ American from a cautious international dabbler to a confident, successful global player in the international health care equipment industry. By improving the lives of others through U.S. technology and innovation, Qureshi met a lifetime goal to make a positive a difference in the world. “When it comes to creating trusting, enduring relationships—business is more effective than politics or diplomacy,” he says. \r\n This success story is also featured in our publication A Basic Guide to Exporting: The Official Government Resource for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses.

The company produces dyes that are used by manufacturers in a variety of end products: printers, pens and markers, soaps and cleaners, wood stains, and specialty applications such as incense and candles. The company was established in 1987 by CEO Luis B. Marrero and two partners, when they bought the dye division of a larger company, identifying the opportunity to focus solely on dyes and colorants. A long time client of the U.S. Commercial Service (CS) office in Newark, New Jersey, Spectra has successfully grown its export business in the last twenty years and now operates in every continent except for Africa. \r\n The Challenge \r\n Operating in many countries with a broad range of products, Spectra Colors faces two main challenges: import regulations and finding distributors. Regulations for goods entering a foreign market differ from one country to the next, and Spectra has faced challenges with these regulations in the past because their products are chemical based. “In Europe, REACH regulations (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals) have caused us lengthy delays and expense,” says Veronica Pellot-Marrero, Manager of Business and Finances at Spectra Colors. Another challenge for the company has been finding reputable agents and distributors for their products internationally. “It’s important that our distributors share our values,” says Pellot-Marrero. “It’s not just about selling our product, but believing in it, and positively representing us abroad.” \r\n Spectra is currently looking to grow its exports to China, India, and Brazil, which are countries with promising manufacturing sectors. The company wants to be prepared, and knows that in China and India, it will face strong competition on price. However, it plans to differentiate itself based on its quality products and focus on the customer. \r\n The Solution \r\n To help Spectra overcome its difficulties with import regulations, CS New Jersey worked closely with other CS offices worldwide. CS New Jersey staff also coordinated with other government agencies such as the Export-Import Bank, to provide Spectra with export insurance and secure their shipments abroad. \r\n To find the right distributors, Spectra has consistently taken advantage of U.S. Commercial Service programs. Luis Marrero attended export financing seminars and Export University. The company also had great success participating in trade missions. “As part of Trade Winds, we travelled to Istanbul, Turkey in 2008, Warsaw, Poland in 2009, and Brazil in 2010,” said Marrero. These trips resulted in many promising leads and potential distributors. Spectra utilized the U.S. Commercial Service business matchmaking services to identify the right partners in China and India, and recently partnered with a plant in India to create rinsable dyes. Meeting with partners through CS events and matchmaking services has helped Spectra find distributors who shared their values. “Often we receive unsolicited requests from foreign partners, and the Commercial Service has helped us verify whether these organizations are reliable. Since our company has grown quickly the Commercial Service has saved us valuable time,” said Marrero. \r\n \r\n CEO Luis Marrero at rinsable dye plant in India \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Spectra Colors has been successful abroad by providing a quality product customized to the buyer’s specific needs, combined with focusing on their core strength – taking care of the customer. “We work hard to make sure production is timely, and that customers receive reliable service and, quality products, and strong technical support,” said Luis Marrero. \r\n Spectra strongly recommends that other companies consider exporting. “There are many opportunities for U.S. companies to export, and resources and guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Export-Import Bank and other organizations,” says Veronica Pellot-Marrero. \r\n Over the years, exporting has become a sizeable part of Spectra Colors’ business, and the firm has added four jobs at their headquarters in Kearny, New Jersey. “Exporting has been very important to our company, and has enabled us to create revenue despite the economic downturn,” says Marrero. \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Participate in a U.S. Commercial Service Event.

Although they soon left the nest to attend school, Sheets knew a good idea when she saw one, and in 1985, with $350, she started a company called—what else?—Two Men and a Truck. She wouldn’t have to worry about moving again and, more importantly, neither would her customers. \r\n “Believe it or not, moving is ranked as the third most stressful event, after death and divorce, so there is a real demand for a service that makes the customer king,” says Sheets. “Our goal is to do things right the first time. The most important concern customers have about moving is that the moving company be there when it says it will.” \r\n With its emphasis on putting the customer first, it wasn’t long before the Lansing, Michigan, firm was expanding its franchising concept across the United States, with Sheets serving as its founder and chief operating officer. By 2001, with her daughter, Melanie Bergeron running day-to-day operations as president and chief operating officer, Sheets was ready to take the franchise concept internationally. \r\n  The Two Men and a Truck Family \r\n The Challenge \r\n One of the biggest challenges for Sheets and Bergeron was that they were only just breaking into the export market. Fortunately, they had attended an International Franchise Association training seminar in Minneapolis, where they connected with Bill Edwards, president of Edwards Global Services, a consultancy company specializing in international franchising expansion. “The biggest challenges for franchisers in going global is getting accurate market research and identifying potential master franchisees,” Edwards says. “In the case of Two Men and a Truck, they faced a third challenge known as market differentiation—otherwise, with plenty of moving businesses out there, why should a potential master franchisee in another country sign on with Two Men and a Truck? What makes it a cut above the rest?” \r\n The company already had an answer to that question, as it placed an exceptional focus on customer service and sophisticated Web-based tracking systems. Those systems would enable Two Men and a Truck’s potential master franchisees to monitor quality control and improve performance measures such as labor costs and the time it takes to complete a move. The company’s tracking systems created a potentially larger profit margin as compared with other moving companies. What Two Men and a Truck needed now was solid market research and a list of highly qualified prospects to convey their business model to potential master franchisees. \r\n The Solution \r\n Edwards Global Services was a long-term client of the Commercial Service’s Newport Beach U.S. Export Assistance Center and had used the center’s export counseling and other services to help several premier franchise brands enter international markets. Among these programs was the Gold Key Service, which arranges business appointments abroad with potential foreign partners, all set up and prescreened by the Commercial Service. Would Two Men and a Truck be Edwards Global Services’ next success? \r\n By 2003, Two Men and a Truck, through Edwards Global Services, worked with the Export Assistance Center to search for a franchise partner in Ireland. They were assisted by the U.S. Commercial Service post in Ireland, whose commercial specialists provided key market research and designed a customized search strategy that included reaching out to databases of existing and potential master licensees. An advertisement was also placed in a local business newspaper highlighting the company’s search for a master licensee. Then, in December 2003, Edwards met with nine qualified prospects in Dublin. Partially as a result of these meetings and ongoing follow-up by the Commercial Service and Edwards Global Services, Two Men and a Truck signed a master license for Ireland in May 2006 with DMG Services. The agreement was valued in excess of $300,000, and included the rights for the U.K. market. \r\n “From a practical standpoint, going international protects our brand globally and it lends credibility to the domestic market,” Bergeron says. “Exporting also makes us more competitive and allows us to diversify our portfolio and weather changes in the economy.” \r\n Lessons Learned \r\n Edwards, whose franchising clients have benefited from many Commercial Service programs over many years, has some important suggestions for franchisers looking to go global, according to the U.S. Commercial Service’s Doug Barry, the editor of A Basic Guide to Exporting from which this case study comes: \r\n \r\n  Don’t cast a wide net when looking for potential partners. Instead, use the Commercial Service to target the best prospects. “Being able to meet with reputable, motivated prospects really helped us in targeting our search efforts,” he says. “Not only was it cost-effective for us, but it would have taken months longer on our own to narrow down the best prospects. The Commercial Service is a source of information, market research, and due diligence that we know we can depend on when doing business around the world.” \r\n Register your trademark. “Not enough people do this, and if you don’t, it can really cost you a lot of money in the long run,” he says. He also recommends that franchisers invest in good market research and personnel training to increase their chances for international franchising success as buyers are becoming very sophisticated. \r\n Know the culture where you are going to do business. For example, Bergeron says that when it comes to moving there are differences. “Americans have so much stuff and bigger houses, while people in emerging markets have much less,” she says. “In emerging markets, many families live together, but we are seeing a growing trend in the use of moving services as people don’t wish to trouble their relatives in helping them move.” \r\n Enjoy the challenge. “Modern franchising is a great American business model that creates highly trained jobs in many countries and helps create more demand for American services,” Edwards says. “And along the way, you meet lots of interesting people.” \r\n  \r\n Action \r\n \r\n  Contact a business consultant. A business consultant that is experienced in the international market can offer invaluable advice. The U.S. Commercial Service is also an excellent place to start exploring your exporting potential. \r\n Use the Gold Key Service. The Commercial Service offers this customized service in key export markets around the world. From making appointments with potential partners, to providing interpreter services for meetings, to helping you close the deal, ship the goods, and get paid, the Gold Key Service offers top-of-the-line assistance.

IT embodies a range of computer systems and software applications for managing a firm's web site, as well as personnel records, back end databases, etc. With more and more cyber attacks on government and corporate sites, companies should invest in security technologies to protect themselves and their customers from identify theft and denial of service. \r\n An IT assessment should answer the following questions: \r\n  What is the firm's current IT usage? Is it at capacity? What are the plans for additional IT investment to upgrade existing systems? \r\n What business applications are best suited to move on line for B2B or B2C electronic? \r\n What does the cost/benefit analysis of all possible projects involving IT show? \r\n What are possible current and future security issues and what is the action plan for correcting problems? \r\n  There are, of course, many other factors to consider in doing international e-commerce, such as executing orders and payment issues that have a special e-commerce perspective, which are are addressed in other parts of this site. \r\n Select A Domain Name \r\n A key component to establishing a web presence is choosing a Universal Resource Locator (URL) and a domain name (i.e., www.computersrus.com). As with URLs aimed toward the domestic market, a URL for an online exporter's website should be short, simple, descriptive and memorable to customers in the target market.ICANN Accredited Registrars will concurrently register your URL and domain name for each country in which you register. \r\n Using Country-Level Domain Codes \r\n Every country (and a few territories) in the world has a reserved, two letter country code domain (e.g, The United Kingdom has the domain .uk; see http://www.thrall.org/domains.htm. An online exporter might want to choose domain names localized for their target markets. Locally branded domain names can increase brand awareness, website address recall and even impact brand sales and loyalty. In addition, most local search engines display locally relevant content by filtering the search results to include local country-code domains only... something to consider when deciding whether to localize or internationalize your site. Companies that want to have a local domain name should research the rules for the particular country, as registration requirements vary. (See www.iana.org, which lists domain name databases and http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld.htm, which includes information on country code top-level domain names.) \r\n Internationalizing Your Domain Name \r\n Companies seeking foreign customers may also consider an \"internationalized\" or \"multilingual\" domain name. Such domain names are web addresses written in characters other than the Roman alphabet. For example, a company called \"Bright Light Bulbs\" wishing to sell in China could have a domain name that would use the Chinese characters for Bright Light Bulbs in its website address. Internationalized or multilingual domain names allow customers to search and access sites in their native language. Again, most ICANN Accredited Registrars can assist you in researching domain names in various countries. \r\n Register at Search Engines \r\n Most people use search engines to find information on the Internet, so website registration with multiple search engines is key to visibility. Search engines range from global in scope to search tools focused on small areas of information. There are a number of international search engines. Some are in native languages and characters (i.e., http://nomade.aliceadsl.fr/). Others are popular English search engines with international links (i.e., http://br.cade.yahoo.com/. Online exporters should register with search engines popular with the target audience in their target markets. \r\n Choose a Web Host \r\n A web host is a company with a server that maintains the files of websites. There are a variety of free and subscription based web host services available, including those offered by many Internet Service Providers. \r\n Web hosting services often go beyond website maintenance to include domain name registration, website design, and search engine registration. For some online exporters, it may be most feasible to use a web host in their target market to take advantage of all of these localized services. The location or nationality of the website host does not impact accessibility of the site. However, when choosing a host, companies should ensure that the host servers reside within a stable infrastructure and are maintained to ensure optimal reliability. Companies also should consider whether they will be storing personal information of EU citizens or citizens of other nations that restrict the export of personal data. EU citizens’ personal data can only be sent to countries deemed “adequate” or to companies using approved model contracts, binding corporate rules, or those participating in the U.S. EU Safe Harbor program. Companies also should take into account potential negative perceptions if they store personal data in nations in which fraud or identity theft are rampant. \r\n As with domestically located web hosting services, agreements should be clear and enforceable about ownership of intellectual property, performance specifications and warranties, security, privacy, the right to transfer the site to a different host, and contract termination. Your contract with a hosting service should provide the same level of security and privacy that your company promises clients whose information it collects, when applicable. \r\n Website Content - Localize \u0026amp; Internationalize \r\n Companies seeking foreign audiences with their websites will want to either localize or internationalize their site, or provide a mixture of both processes. Forrester Research notes that \"visitors linger twice as long [on international sites] as they do at English-only URLs; business buyers are three times more likely to buy if addressed in their own language; and customer services costs drop when instructions are displayed in the user's language.\" \r\n Localization consists of adapting one's website to meet the linguistic, cultural, and commercial requirements of a targeted market. Internationalizing a firm's website enables the company to be multilingual and be sensitive to cultural conventions without the need for extensive redesign. Localization or internationalization must be part of the online exporter's corporate strategy for website and business development. Features that should be considered include: \r\n  Language \r\n Cultural nuance, such as differences in color association and symbols \r\n Payment preferences \r\n Pricing in the appropriate currency \r\n Web metrics and visitor reports \r\n Regular maintenance and updating \r\n  More information on localization and internationalization can be found at the website for the Localization Industry Standards Association, www.lisa.org or the Globalization and Localization Association, www.gala-global.org. \r\n Execute Orders \r\n Guidelines for order execution and after-sales service are similar for offline and online transactions. Companies planning to export via the Internet should be knowledgeable about the topics discussed in the Online Payment \u0026amp; Taxes, Pricing Tariffs \u0026amp; Shipping and the E-ssentials sections of this website.

In general, the FCPA prohibits American companies from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The Department of Justice is the chief enforcement agency, with a coordinate role played by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Office of General Counsel of the Department of Commerce also answers general questions of U.S. exporters concerning the FCPA's basic requirements and constraints. \r\n Anti-Boycott Regulations \r\n The United States has an established policy of opposing restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries friendly to the United States. In general, anti-boycott regulations prohibit U.S. persons from participating in foreign boycotts or taking actions that further or support such boycotts. The laws are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security. \r\n Anti-Dumping \r\n If a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it normally charges on its own home market, it could be said to be \"dumping\" the product. Opinions differ as to whether or not this is unfair competition, but many governments take action against dumping in order to defend their domestic industries. The World Trade Organization (WTO) under the \"Anti-Dumping Agreement\" does not regulate the actions of companies engaged in \"dumping.\" The agreement focuses on how governments can or cannot react to dumping -- it disciplines anti-dumping actions. This is different from the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures which disciplines the use of subsidies. The Agreement regulates the actions countries can take to counter the effects of subsidies and allows a country to use the WTO's dispute-settlement procedure to seek the withdrawal of the subsidy or the removal of its adverse effects. \r\n Additional Resources \r\n  Legal resources: Resolving trade disputes \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-12","title":"Corrupt Business Practices in Exporting","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":["Trade Problems"],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"231","content":" \r\n The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the export of most commercial items, often referred to as \"dual-use\" items which are those having both commercial and military or proliferation applications. Relatively few exports of dual-use items require obtaining an export license from BIS prior to shipment. \r\n Dual use export licenses are required in certain situations involving national security, foreign policy, short-supply, nuclear non-proliferation, missile technology, chemical and biological weapons, regional stability, crime control, or terrorist concerns. The license requirements are dependent upon an item's technical characteristics, the destination, the end-use, and the end-user, and other activities of the end-user. Even if a license is not required, there may be additional requirements you must satisfy prior to exporting. Before shipping your product, make sure you understand the concept of dual use and the basic export control regulations, including end-user and end-use based controls. \r\n Is an Export License Required? \r\n \r\n The first step in establishing whether a dual-use item (i.e. commodity, software or technology) requires a license is to determine the product's Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) on the Commerce Control List (CCL). ECCNs identify reasons for control which indicate licensing requirements to certain destinations. Other reasons an export license may be required for your shipment relate to concerns about the parties to the transaction and the end-use of the item. \r\n If your item falls under U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction and is not listed on the CCL, it is designated as EAR99. EAR99 items generally consist of low-technology or consumer goods and do not require a license in many situations. If your proposed export of an EAR99 item is to an embargoed country, to an end-user of concern or in support of a prohibited end-use, you may be required to obtain a license. \r\n Screening Your Customer \r\n \r\n Certain individuals and organizations are prohibited from receiving U.S. exports. Others may only receive goods if the transaction has been licensed, even for items that do not normally require a license based on the ECCN and country or based on an EAR99 designation. There are various lists that may be relevant to your export or reexport transaction. These are listed below and include entities with which an exporter is prohibited from doing business, under most circumstances. \r\n  \nDenied Persons List -- A list of individuals and entities that have been denied export privileges. Any dealings with a party on this list that would violate the terms of its denial order is prohibited. \r\n \nUnverified List --A list of parties where BIS has been unable to verify the end-user in prior transactions. The presence of a party on this list in a transaction is a \"Red Flag\" that should be resolved before proceeding with the transaction. \r\n \nEntity List -- A list of parties whose presence in a transaction can trigger a license requirement under the Export Administration Regulations. These end users have been determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to developing weapons of mass destruction or the missiles used to deliver those weapons and contrary to U.S. national security and/or foreign policy interests. Inclusion on the list may also be a result of activities sanctioned by the State Department and activities contrary to U.S. national security and/or foreign policy interests. \r\n \nSpecially Designated Nationals List -- Alphabetical master list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons compiled by the Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). \r\n \nDebarred List -- A list compiled by the State Department of parties who are barred by §127.7 of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR §127.7) from participating directly or indirectly in the export of defense articles, including technical data or in the furnishing of defense services for which a license or approval is required by the ITAR \r\n  Due to the frequency of additions and changes to these lists, U.S. exporters need to check these lists regularly for updates. \r\n Submitting a License Application \r\n If you need an export license from BIS for your transaction, the SNAPR on-line electronic licensing system allows registered users to submit export and re-export license application. You must first obtain a PIN prior to submitting an electronic license application or commodity classification request. \r\n Reporting a Possible Violation \r\n BIS implements as well as enforces the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Export Enforcement relies heavily on the partnership it has with the business community. An online form is available to report a lead or a tip on possible export control, Fastener Quality Act (FQA), Chemical Weapons Convention Regulation (CWCR) or boycott related violations. \r\n Additional Resources \r\n  More about BIS export licensing\n \r\n On-line training room \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-12","title":"Dual Use Licenses","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":["Aerospace \u0026 Defense"],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]}]}
