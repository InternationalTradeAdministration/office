<div class="content"> The National Customs Brokers &amp; Forwarders Association of America (NCBFAA) is sponsoring the Automated Export System (AES) Compliance Seminar. The Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division participates as presenters at these seminars. The goal of these seminars is to introduce the new Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) to the international trade community and to emphasize the importance of export compliance. The seminars began in March 2008 and will continue throughout the year. Find out how to register. 
 The upcoming seminars offer an opportunity for attendees to learn the new mandatory requirements as specified in the FTR. In each two-day seminar, subject matter experts from the Census Bureau will discuss the new regulations, the mandatory Automated Export System (AES) and classification of commodities. On the second day an optional hands-on training will be provided for those who are interested becoming certified in using the AES Direct/AESPcLink software or who simply want to refresh their training. The full-day seminar includes continental breakfast, lunch, two breaks and training materials. The workshop cost includes only the 3.5 hour workshop and training materials. Costs vary, depending on location. Please contact us as shown below for specific seminar and workshop information. 
 We want to help the international trade community get it right the first time and therefore avoid costly encounters with enforcement agencies.
