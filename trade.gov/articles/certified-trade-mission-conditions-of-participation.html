<div class="content"> A. Overview 
 Commercial Service (formally referred to as the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service) Certified Trade Missions are overseas events planned, organized, and led by federal agencies or non-federal export promotion organizations (such as industry trade associations, agencies of state and local governments, chambers of commerce, regional groups, and other export-oriented groups) in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
 Certified Trade Missions provide a flexible format in which to conduct overseas business. U.S. companies meet face to face with potential agents, distributors, joint venture partners, licensees, relevant businesses and government contacts. Seminars on local business practices with participation by banks, lawyers, and other authorities can be arranged. Special working level events are also available to further enhance the event, which may also include plant and factory tours or follow a seminar format for technical products. Within the mission's framework, Commercial Service overseas posts provide guidance and support to mission organizers and participating companies on the mission. 
 B. Criteria 
 To qualify for Commercial Service certification, the mission must have, as a primary objective, the promotion of U.S.-produced goods and services and/or the establishment of marketing representation abroad. Goods and/or services promoted must either be manufactured or produced in the United States, or, if manufactured or produced outside of the United States, be marketed under the name of a U.S. firm and have U.S. content representing at least fifty-one percent of the value of the finished goods or services. 
 Products/services represented on the mission must be a compatible group within a product theme (or themes) that, in the Commercial Service's determination, offers substantial market opportunities. Single-industry theme (vertical) missions are preferable because promotional efforts can be targeted more effectively toward appropriate end-user audiences. Advance concurrence of the overseas posts on the product mix of the mission and its itinerary and timing is required. 
 To participate in a Commercial Service Certified Trade Mission, the organizer must enter into a participation agreement with the post(s) hosting the mission. Generally, this agreement will incorporate the following Conditions of Participation, which post(s) and organizer may modify by mutual consent. Sponsoring organizations should apply by submitting an Application for Certified Trade Mission Organizers to the appropriate overseas post(s). 
 Federal Government agencies seeking certification will coordinate through the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) events working group before approaching the overseas Commercial Service post(s). 
 For additional information, please contact your nearest U.S. Export Assistance Center.

Counseling should include export financing documentation and market research. 
 6. Report all export successes and client feedback to posts and the OIO regional director. Be sure to credit post in export successes. 
 
 Responsibilities of the Sponsoring Organizer's Advance Officer 
 Where it is agreed between the Commercial Service post and the sponsoring organization that an advance officer is necessary, the advance officer shall: 
 1. Arrange a time in writing beneficial to both the appropriate Commercial Service post(s) and the partnership organization to begin his or her advance travel. Generally, this will be approximately 90 days prior to departure of the mission.

 3. Carry information and product literature for each mission participant in sufficient quantities to leave at least one set at each affected overseas post. 
 4. Carry funds and international credit cards, with full authority to commit funds for mission expenses. 
 5. Work directly with each affected overseas post to develop the mission program and finalize the mission budget at each stop. 
 Responsibilities of the Mission Director 
 The sponsoring organization's mission director shall: 
 1. Ensure that mission participants adhere to the mission program and promptly keep all individual appointments at each stop. 
 2. Carry additional mission funds and international credit cards to ensure that all mission expenses not previously deposited with the Commercial Service post are paid before leaving each stop, and that mission participants' bills are similarly paid. 
 3. Ensure that each mission participant: 
 (a) Is fully responsible for his or her individual travel and personal expenses; 
 (b) Makes all necessary arrangements for entry permit visas and other travel documentation; 
 (c) Is an active member or representative of his or her firm; and

 Financial Provisions 
 1. Sponsoring organizations that are federal agencies or quasi-federal agencies shall: 
 (a) Describe at the time of application where individual participation fees will be deposited, e.g., with the sponsoring agency or Commercial Service; 
 (b) Describe at the time of application the method of payment to be used. Options include: 
 ( I) Full payment by check (made payable to the U.S. Department of Commerce) with submission of Participation Agreement; 
 (ii) Cable from agency to overseas post(s) transferring payment and authorizing spending; or 
 (iii) Interagency transfer of funds with submission of Participation Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding; and 
 (c) Provide original copies of payment documents to the Department for processing not less than 60 days prior to mission departure. 
 2. Sponsoring state organizations that are legally prohibited from providing prepayment as described in Section A shall provide to the Department not less than 60 days prior to mission departure a legally binding document, such as a purchase order in U.S. dollars or a letter of intent, committing to provide 50 percent of the mission budget, within 5 working days of the conclusion of the mission. The remaining balance is due upon receipt of final invoice(s) from the affected overseas post(s). Sponsoring organizations should contact the overseas post(s) for prior approval of language that purports to legally bind the organization. 
 3. All other sponsoring organizations will handle payment as described in C.A.5 and C.D.2 above unless agreed in writing and made a part of the "Conditions of Participation." 
 Bonding Provisions 
 1. For-profit sponsoring organizations shall obtain a bond from a surety company holding a certificate of authority from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Financial Management Service, as periodically published in the Federal Register. 
 2. The bond will ensure that a mission participant can recover a participation fee paid to the sponsoring organization, as well as any other reasonable pre-paid transportation costs, should the sponsoring organization fail to meet its obligations to the mission participant concerning the mission. 
 The amount of the bond must be sufficient to cover these fees and estimated transportation costs. 
 3. The bonding agreement must be signed by the sponsoring organization (principal) and a bonding company (surety). A bond beneficiary is defined as an individual or entity from which, or on behalf of which, the principal receives and retains a participant fee for the mission. 
 4. Bonds will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, as there is no standard form agreement. 
 5. An executed and pre-paid-in-full bond must be completed, and a copy of this bonding document shall be presented to the Commercial Service post before approval of the trade mission will be granted. 
 6. A copy of the bond must be made available to mission participants either by the sponsoring organization or the bonding company. 
 7. The bond requirement does not constitute a guarantee by the Department of reimbursement for financial losses to mission participants in connection with the mission. 
 8. Should either party terminate the bond agreement, the terminating party must notify the Department and make a reasonable effort to notify the bond beneficiaries. Therefore, the organizer must provide a listing of all mission participants, including valid mailing addresses, to the bonding company no later than 30 days prior to departure of the mission. 
 Cancellations 
 1. All notice of cancellations must be in writing. Upon written notice of cancellation of the mission, the Department will secure an accounting by the affected overseas post(s) of costs incurred by them in connection with the mission. Such costs may include those incurred for fax/phone, postage, personnel overtime, printing, and contract services. If such costs exceed the amount previously received, or if no funds have been received, the Department will bill the sponsoring organization for the amount of the excess or its costs, as applicable.
