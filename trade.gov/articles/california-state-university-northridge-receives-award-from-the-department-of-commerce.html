 California State University Northridge (CSUN) is a vibrant university in Los Angeles with over 34000 students and 4000 faculty and staff. In 2003, CSUN College of Business &amp; Economics was faced with serious challenges that jeopardized its ability to continue to offer the international business major to its students and community. The College of Business &amp; Economics faculty relied on the staff of the U.S. Department of Commerce and other agencies such as the Department of Education and the California Center for International Trade to help promote international business educational activities for undergraduate students including a learning export consulting seminar, a Certificate program in International Business and a new global logistics major. 
 Staff from the U.S. Commercial Service including Downtown and West Los Angeles USEAC Directors Rachid Sayouty and Julieanne Hennessy were always available to provide presentations at CSUN export consulting seminar series program which is attended by a number of small business owners interested in better understanding the basics of exporting. 
 The effort of CSUN College of Business &amp; Economics in expanding its international business program has helped students and many small businesses learn to take advantage of the vast opportunities in international markets. 
 With its network of offices across the United States and in more than 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration utilizes its global presence and international marketing expertise to help U.S. companies sell their products and services worldwide.
