 This report presents updates on the Brazilian ethanol and biodiesel policies and programs since the Biofuels Annual report from 2011. It provides production, supply and demand estimates and forecasts for 2012 and 2013. [August 2012] 
 Buenos Aires Biodiesel Tax Increase and Temporary Soybean Import Policy 
 The Government of Argentina (GOA) recognizes that the biodiesel industry has contributed quite a bit to Argentina’s industrialization of the soy industry. In fact, production has more than tripled over the last five years and more than half of production is exported. However, last year, supplies were short because of a hard hit drought and in March 2012, members of the crushing industry asked the GOA to consider raising soybean export taxes in order to promote more incentive to crush in-country. Temporary imports of soybeans will be allowed into Argentina for the purpose of crushing in-country to fill the gap in crushing capacity. [August 2012] 
 Germany: Debate over E10 fuel in light of drought in the United States 
 The German Minister of Development and Economic Cooperation is positioning himself as an opponent of bioethanol, using current reports about the drought in the United States and its potential to drive up food prices. In an interview with a German news TV station he called for a halt in sales of “E10” gasoline. However, so far he has not received backing from other German ministries. [August 2012] 
 Indonesia: 2012 Biofuels Report  
 Indonesian biodiesel production increased significantly in 2011. It is predicted that it will increase in 2012 and 2013. Domestic users consumed 10 percent of the increased biodiesel production, with almost 90 percent of the biodiesel going to overseas markets. Europe has become a single largest market for Indonesia, with Indonesia’s market penetration in the region 39 percent of total European biodiesel import in 2011 (up from 9 percent in 2008). [August 2012] 
 Malaysia: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 Despite very optimistic expectations just a few years ago, Malaysia’s biodiesel sector is not yet economically viable. High feedstock prices, little domestic demand, subsidized alternative petroleum based products, and stiff competition from Indonesian supplies in export markets have stymied development of Malaysia’s bio-diesel industry. A majority of the plants are idle. The Government of Malaysia has started to implement a B5 mandate (palm biodiesel), but domestic consumption is expected to remain stagnant. [August 2012] 
 Department of Energy: Developments in U.S. Ethanol Exports 
 The United States exported record levels of ethanol through the end of 2011 and looks to be on track to continue exporting significant volumes during 2012. While there are a number of complexities and potential renewable fuel mixes in store for the United States in 2012, it is likely to be a net exporter of ethanol, albeit at lower levels than in 2011. [July 2012] 
 Honduras: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 Honduras is the only Central America country that has a law and a regulation for both biodiesel and ethanol production. Honduras’ increase in the production of African palm oil provides opportunities for biodiesel. Additionally, new initiatives have been established such as the production of biofuel from tilapia by-products and jatropha, the production of biogas sold for carbon credits, and the production of biomass to burn for electricity. However, there is no commercial production of biofuels due to market constraints. [July 2012] 
 Argentina: 2012 Biofuels Report  
 This report reviews Argentine biodiesel production and consumption projections. The closing of the Spanish market, Argentina’s top export destination, is forecast to hurt overall exports. The government is contemplating increasing the mandate mix from 7 to 10 percent. The report also predicts bioethanol production for 2013 including the incorporation of five new grain-based plants. [July 2012] 
 People's Republic of China: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 China’s fuel ethanol production is forecast to increase by eight percent in 2012, despite the fact that there are no new ethanol plants or mandatory-use programs for fuel ethanol or biodiesel. However for biodiesel, without government subsidies or mandatory-use programs, producers and processing plants must operate under inconsistent profit margins and price fluctuations for feed stocks. [July 2012] 
 Russian Federation: Biofuels Sector Update 
 The Russian government outlined as a national objective making the country 40 percent more energy-efficient by 2020. However as one of the world's leading producers and exporters of oil and gas, biofuels have an insignificant share in the overall energy production matrix of Russia with an estimate of 1.2 percent, and biomass accounting for only 0.5 percent. As a result, the emerging Russian biofuels industry is driven primarily by growing demand for biofuels from Europe. [July 2012] 
 Canada: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 As the Canadian biofuels industry is preparing to comply with requirements, production of ethanol and biodiesel have increased over the past year. Ethanol production in 2012 is estimated to increase 40% from 2011 levels, and biodiesel production is estimated to increase nearly 80%. At this time, the Canadian biofuels industry remains below estimates to meet the federal standards, and limited production suggests that Canada will not soon become a major player in the global ethanol market. [July 2012] 
 Colombian Biofuels Use Reaching E10 and B10 Levels 
 In 2011, ethanol production recovered to 351 million liters due to an increase in sugarcane supply, and in 2012 production is expected to reach 355 million liters. Biodiesel production also recovered to 537 million liters in 2011.The expansion of 300,000 liters in production capacity is expected to boost ethanol production to 400 million liters in 2013. Blends target of B10 and E10 are yet to be reached for the entire country; Colombia is not expected to export biofuels in the next two years. [July 2012] 
 The European Union: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 EU Member States (MS) are mandated to reach a minimum of 10% for renewable energy consumed in transport in 2020. In 2011, about a fifth of the domestic use of biofuels was imported from outside the EU. Despite a reclassification of bioethanol blends to a higher tariff rate, 2012 and 2013 imports from the United States are anticipated to remain around 1 billion liters. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in 2013, overall EU imports of biodiesel are expected to decrease as a result of enforcement of the Spanish quota system, which only accepts biodiesel produced in the EU. The European Commission (EC) expects heat and power production from biomass to play an important role in meeting the 20% target for renewable energy use by 2020 and in the future reduction of CO2 emissions in Europe. [June 2012] 
 Thailand: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 The Thai Government has modified its 15-year Alternative Energy Development Plan, which has fallen short of achieving its short-term target. Ethanol production will likely continue to increase in 2012 and 2013 driven by strong export demand. Biodiesel production is estimated to grow steadily in 2012 and 2013 reflecting the implementing of mandatory B5 biodiesel use. [June 2012] 
 Japan Focuses on Next Generation Biofuels  
 In 2011, Japanese ethanol and biodiesel production increased but remained at low levels. Imports of ethanol for fuel and other uses also increased while ETBE imports in 2011 held steady. Due to limited agricultural production, and the “food vs. fuel” debate, the Government of Japan has opted to focus determinedly on biofuels derived from cellulosic materials or other materials which do not compete with the food supply. Nevertheless, overall Japanese production of biofuels is expected to continue expanding. [June 2012] 
 El Salvador: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 The current Government of El Salvador (GOES) has not approved the Ethanol Law created by the previous administration. The GOES has not made a decision on the gasoline-ethanol mix ratio; and high international sugar prices have decreased interest in the sugarcane industry to lobby for the ethanol law. There are currently several bio-fuel initiatives being implemented to produce bio-diesel. [June 2012] 
 Paraguay: 2012 Biofuels Report  
 While ethanol in Paraguay is expected to reach a record, biodiesel production and consumption is still forecast to remain well below the current mandate of 1 percent. The pricing of biodiesel and some quality/standard problems in the past have discouraged the local expansion of production. Two new large oilseeds crushing plants will be on-line in 2013/14, duplicating the country’s production capacity. This could encourage the government to set conditions to start meeting the delayed mandates. [June 2012] 
 Ecuador Biofuel Industry, Bioethanol, Biodiesel, Production, Forecast 2012 
 Ecuador’s executive branch of government has been very keen on speaking up about the need for a biofuels policy and biofuels programs. However, despite the interest of the private sector as well, no biofuels policy exists at the moment. The Government of Ecuador is undertaking pilot projects to use bioethanol for the city of Guayaquil and jathropha biodiesel for the Galapagos Islands. [June 2012] 
 Peru: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 This report reviews expected 2012 production of ethanol and biodiesel in Peru, as well as forecasts for 2013. [June 2012] 
 A big splash of Ethanol and a drop of Biodiesel in Guatemala 
 In 2011, Guatemala increased its installed alcohol capacity; derived from sugarcane processing, most of Guatemala's ethanol is exported to Europe. Biodiesel production is extremely limited due to a lack of commercial feedstock. Guatemala's government is considering various biofuel strategies, but has not taken any specific action. [June 2012] 
 Australia: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 Imports of Biodiesel from the United States are subject to a “Countervailing Duty” and “Dumping Duty” which is expected to be in place for a total of five years and, per calculations, would expire in April 2016. Despite these measures, official trade data shows the continued importation of biodiesel from overseas suppliers, including the US and Canada. The United States and Australia are also collaborating on research and development regarding the safe use of sustainable aviation alternative fuels. [June 2012] 
 Thailand Imposes Export Surcharge on Crude Palm Oil 
 Thailand’s Ministry of Commerce has imposed an export surcharge of approximately $317 per metric ton on crude palm oil, effective through June 30, 2012. According to the report, the move came following government action in April to import 40,000 tons of semirefined palm oil, which was done to alleviate shortages and increasing prices. [June 2012] 
 Malaysia’s Crude Palm Oil production rises 5% to 1.3 million Tons 
 After almost 24 months of growth in production, the palms are undergoing biological stress causing lower yields. Palm oil exports rose marginally to 1.3 million tons in April. Output for April, however, was down 6.8 percent when compared to production levels over the same period in 2011. The Malaysian report also indicates a marginal increase in palm oil exports. [June 2012] 
 Brazil's Ethanol Industry 
 The Brazil Industries Coalition (BIC) Magazine recently discussed business opportunities in Brazil with Igly Serafim, Senior Commercial Specialist with the U.S. Commercial Service in Sao Paulo Brazil. With the growth of Brazil’s ethanol industry, and new demands for renewable fuels in the United States and elsewhere, new business opportunities in Brazil are emerging for U.S. companies. [May 2012] 
 Romania: RED Process Complete 
 Romania finalized transposition of the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28 into national legislation with the latest order that describes certification processes and documentation requirements attesting that the biofuels meet the sustainability criteria. In terms of biofuels production, although official data shows national production capacity at 300,000 Mt/year for biodiesel and 120,000 Mt/year for ethanol, Romanian fuel retailers cover a major part of the biofuels necessary for blending mandates through imports. [May 2012] 
 Chile: Evolution of Biofuels 
 Chile’s current energy sector conditions, characterized by high import dependency, are driving the trend toward new energy alternatives and resources in the country. Unlike the U.S. and Brazil, Chile does not have enough land to produce both food and biofuels, and is looking to second generation fuels, including algae. [March 2012] 
 Portugal: Biofuels 2011 
 According to this USDA report, there is no production of bioethanol for transport fuel in Portugal. Biodiesel production is steady at approximately 350,000 MT under a quota system. [February 2012] 
 Brazil: GoB Support to Sugar-Ethanol Sector 
 On January 11, Brazil’s National Bank for Social and Economic Development (BNDES) announced a credit line of US$2.25 billion (R$4 billion) available until December 31, 2012, called Prorenova, to finance the renewal and/or expansion of approximately 2.5 million acres of sugarcane fields. BNDES expects that its financing will lead to 2 to 4 billion liters of additional ethanol production in central-southern Brazil over the next two years. [January 2012] 
 EU: Sustainability in Commodity Markets 
 In 2011, the EU imported about $2 billion, or a third of its total ethanol imports, from the United States. Renewable Energy Directive (RED) certification and several other international agreements also play an important role in the European market for ethanol. [January 2012] 
 The U.S. Biodiesel Market 2000 to 2010: Riding the Rollercoaster 
 Commodity price volatility and the price spread between feedstocks and fossil fuel as well as policy support that lacks long-term stability have created challenges for the biodiesel industry worldwide. Exports drove significant growth in the biodiesel industry from 2005 to 2008, but in 2009, a dropoff in U.S. exports to the EU and antidumping and countervailing duties imposed by several countries – though partially offset by growth in markets like Taiwan, India, and Australia – slowed the industry down. Going forward, the U.S. biodiesel industry is poised to begin a sustained period of growth. [January 2012] 
 Italy: Biofuels 2011 
 The Italian biofuels industry is slowly developing to meet the EU’s 2020 mandatory 10-percent biofuels use in transportation fuels. However, lack of government support, stiff competition from South America, and a complicated and uncertain EU and Italian legislative framework are severely hampering the industry’s growth. [January 2012] 
 Brazil: Ethanol Import Tariff 
 In December 2011, the Brazilian Government extended the zero percent import tariff applied to ethanol until December 15, 2015. According to the Mercosur (Common Southern Market) agreement, the import tariff for ethanol is 20 percent; however, since April 2010, at the request of the Government of Brazil, ethanol was included in the list of exceptions, with an applied tariff rate of zero percent. [January 2012]

 Philippines: Biofuels 
 The Philippines is a regional pioneer in renewable energy (RE) and has biofuels legislation in place that calls for the blending of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline and diesel fuel. RE sources accounted for 43 percent of the country’s primary energy mix in 2009. However, its contribution to total power supply is likely to decline in the next five years due to its comparatively higher cost and the preference of local officials to turn to familiar sources of power to address rapidly growing demand. Ethanol imports are expected to increase through at least 2012 in order to satisfy local ethanol-blended gasoline requirements. [August 2011] 
 Brazil: Biofuels 2011
