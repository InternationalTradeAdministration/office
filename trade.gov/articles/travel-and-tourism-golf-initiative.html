<div class="content"> The U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Commercial Service Travel and Tourism Team is implementing a worldwide golf initiative. The main purpose of this initiative is to increase Golf Tourism from foreign markets into the United States. According to the United States World Golf Foundation, golf is a $76 billion industry, with a total impact on the U.S. economy in excess of $2 billion. 
 The U.S. Commercial Service will leverage its network of Export Assistance Centers throughout the United States to identify golf destinations and resorts with strong potential for attracting more overseas travellers. The U.S. Commercial Service through its worldwide network of tourism experts in consulates and embassies around the world will identify and target outbound golf tour operators and golf travel writers in their respective markets to promote U.S. golf destinations. Additionally, the U.S. Commercial Service will work in coordination with current organizations and entities such as the International Association of Golf Tour Operators, the World Golf Foundation, Reed Exhibition, and the Professional Golf Association to facilitate their mission of increasing golf participation and tourism. For more details, contact Mr. Robert Stackpole, Robert.Stackpole@trade.gov or Mr. Paul Tambakis, Paul.Tambakis@trade.gov.
