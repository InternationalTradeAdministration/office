<div class="content"> Giving U.S. Exporters a Leading Edge in World Markets 
 Exhibiting at a trade show abroad can lead to tremendous export opportunities for U.S. companies. 
 
 The U.S. Commercial Service’s Trade Fair Certification program is a cooperative arrangement between private sector trade show organizers and the U.S. government to increase U.S. exports and expand U.S. participation in overseas trade shows. 
 Trade Show Organizers may apply for Trade Fair Certification in order to offer U.S. exhibitors the export assistance services provided by the U.S. Commercial Service. 
 Who’s Eligible for Trade Fair Certification? 
 Trade associations, trade fair authorities, U.S. show organizers, American Chambers of Commerce, U.S. agents of overseas fair organizers, and other private sector entities that organize and manage international fairs overseas are eligible to seek certification to organize a U.S. pavilion. 
   
 Organizers must have a U.S. office and experience in organizing trade shows, trade missions, or similar activities to qualify for certification. No financial assistance is provided to organizers or exhibitors under the Trade Fair Certification Program. However, individual state development agencies may have programs providing financial assistance to organizers and U.S. firms from their state to help them exhibit overseas.
