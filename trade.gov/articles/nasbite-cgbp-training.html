<div class="content"> Led by NASBITE International, each training organization matches training to standard. Some of the institutions participating are:

 University of Texas San Antonio

  This training has been developed in accordance with NASBITE International (formerly known as North American Small Business International Trade Educators) guidelines for a Certified Global Business Professional (CGBP) credential, a nationally recognized professional credential that demonstrates an individual's competency in international trade. 
 Modules go over the following subjects: 
  Global Management 
 Global Marketing 
 Supply Chain Management 
 Trade Finance 
 Intercultural Awareness 
 Government Resources 
 Trade Compliance 
 Documentation 
  Optional: Exam Review (Practice Tests, Case Studies) 
 Course Information 
 Courses are available in various locations with some online availability. A typical training set is 5 days, distributed over a 30 day period with a 1 day exam. When these training sets are offered at the Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), most follow the Export Training Assistance Partnership (ETAP) model. The training sets are a combination of classroom and self-study. 
 Besides attending the modules, participants are expected to study. People without international trade experience will require a significant amount of outside study if they wish to sit for the national NASBITE CGBP exam. 
 Course cost ranges from $300 to $1000, with an average cost of $700. 
 Audience 
 In order to get the CGBP credential participants must have completed at least two years of college-level classes or worked in the international trade field at least two years. People without experience may participate but a larger amount of study will be required. Courses are at the Intermediate to Advanced level.
