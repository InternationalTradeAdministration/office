 Located in Charleston, SC, MeadWestVaco – Specialty Chemicals Division has been working with the U.S. Commercial Service since April 2003. A customized market report was prepared for the company by the U.S. Commercial Service post in Shanghai, China. Mr. Carl Day, Business Development, took advantage of meeting with Commercial Specialists at that post during a trip to China to further discuss MeadWestVaco’s export development plans for that market. 
 Using the information provided in the customized market report, the company recently confirmed their opening of a procurement office in Shanghai and a wholly-owned subsidiary, which will act as their own trading company. These offices will serve a part of the huge Chinese market for Activated Carbon, Asphalt Chemicals, Ink Resins, Dye Stuffs, and Tall Oil/Fatty Acids.
