<div class="content"> REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restrictions of Chemicals) is a major reform of EU chemicals policy, affecting all global supply chains that produce and use chemicals.  It is particularly important for small- and medium-sized companies to know about requirements under REACH and how to comply with this regulation, in force in all EU Member States since June 2007.  This two-part series addresses REACH Fundamentals and CLP Transition and Supply Chain Compliance. In the first webinar, EU REACH Part I, it will cover the key elements, products covered, exemptions and deadlines. This webinar will also cover the practicalities of REACH from business planning to registration, understanding the implications, potential costs, your legal entity in Europe, finding the data you need, co-registrants, SIEF’s and preparing and submitting your dossier.
