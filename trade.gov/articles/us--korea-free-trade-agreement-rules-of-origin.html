<time>January 4, 2013</time>
<div class="content"> The information provided here provides general guidance on how to locate the relevant rules of origin and determine whether your product may qualify for a reduced tariff/duty benefit under KORUS. Special rules apply for textile and apparel products and certain agricultural and industrial products. 
 Only the Korean Customs Service can definitively determine whether a product qualifies for preferential treatment, and official advance (prospective) rulings can be requested from them prior to exportation. Additional information can be found at the Korean Government sponsored U.S.Korea Connect. 
 Rules of origin (ROOs) are used to define which products may qualify for preferential tariff rates under a trade agreement. These rules vary by trade agreement and product. As a general matter, the importer is responsible for claiming preferential treatment from the importing country’s customs authority. 
 Below are five basic steps to ascertain whether your export may qualify for the FTA-negotiated preferential tariff rate (FTA rate) under KORUS: 
  Determine your product's tariff classification 
 Determine whether there is an advantage to claiming preferential treatment 
 Identify the rule of origin under KORUS 
 Document origin &amp; keeping records 
  Additionally, make sure that you are permitted to export your product and that your product complies with U.S. export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as with the foreign regulations and standards of Korea. 
 For questions relating to customs requirements for importing into the United States under KORUS, please refer to U.S. Customs and Border Protection interim regulations and implementing instructions.
