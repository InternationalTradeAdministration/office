 Go2Call Software of Evanston, Illinois was the recipient of an Export Achievement Certificate on June 20, 2007 for its extensive accomplishments in the global marketplace. Director General of US Commercial Service Israel Hernandez presented John Nix, CEO of Go2Call Software, with the award at the NXTcomm show in Chicago, Illinois. Also present were Muna Farkouh of CS Amman, Ahmed Al-Khayyat of CS Riyadh and Julie Carducci of CS Chicago. Addressing attendees at NXTComm's International Business Development Panel, Mr. Nix said “the Commercial Service is the best use of my tax dollars, and it has helped us enter countries that would have been difficult for us to enter on our own.” 
 Since 2002, Go2Call has been a frequent user of CS services, reporting successes using the Gold Key Matching Service in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey, the Philippines and the UAE. Commercial Service value-added support had a direct role in supporting Go2Call's exports to Jordan, India, Japan, Thailand and Singapore.
