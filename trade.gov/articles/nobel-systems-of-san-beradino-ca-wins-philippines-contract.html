 Nobel Systems of San Bernadino, California recently received a two-year contract from the San Pedro Water District Water District (SBWD) in the Philippines. This contract was a direct result of the Environmental Technologies Trade Mission to Manilla held on April 24 – May 3, 2006 organized by Commercial Specialist Bebe Montesines of CS Manilla. “That visit was truly outstanding,” says Michael Samuel, President of Nobel Systems. (www.nobel-systems.com). "It would never have happened without Bebe’s support. Bebe was the person who introduced me to San Pedro, and also to CEST. What a perfect way to start my export business," 
 On February 15, 2007, SPWD general manager signed a contract for the supply, installation and service of Nobel's GIS at CS Manila's office. The two-year contract is worth $127,171(Pesos6.15 million), with Nobel's portion of the contract amounting to $48,132.
