It is issued by the appropriate licensing agency after a careful review of the facts surrounding the given export transaction. Most export transactions do not require specific approval in the form of licenses from the U.S. Government. In fact, a relatively small percentage of all U.S. export transactions require licenses from the U.S. government. It is up to the exporter to determine whether the product requires a license and to research the end use of the product, in other words, to perform “due diligence” regarding the transaction. Exporters should learn which federal department or agency has jurisdiction over the item they are planning to export in order to find out if a license is required. \r\n Export Control Reform Initiative* \r\n The Administration is engaged in a fundamental reform of the U.S. export control system to enhance U.S. national security and strengthen the United States' ability to counter threats such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

These programs should include a manual that articulates the company's policy on and commitment to compliance with defense trade laws and regulations, and that outlines the procedures for dealing with licensing and compliance matters. Such a manual should also include the identification and duties of empowered and responsible persons, and procedures on record keeping and internal auditing. \r\n Commodity Jurisdiction \r\n An exporter should request a commodity jurisdiction (CJ) determination to resolve any uncertainty regarding the export licensing jurisdiction of an item or service. A CJ is used to determine whether an item or service is subject to the export licensing authority of BIS or DTC. \r\n Response Team \r\n The DDTC Response Team provides responses to the full range of defense trade inquiries, and can significantly facilitate your defense trade solutions while affording licensing and other officers in DDTC more time for casework.

NAFTA created the world's largest free trade area, which links 454 million people producing over $17.2 trillion worth of goods and services in 2010. The dismantling of trade barriers and the opening of markets has led to economic growth and rising prosperity in all three countries. \r\n Total merchandise trade among the United States, Canada, and Mexico reached $944.6 billion in 2010, an increase of 218% since 1993. Canada and Mexico are our first and third largest merchandise trading partners, accounting for 32.3 percent of U.S. exports to the world in 2010. \r\n The NAFTA provides coverage to services with the exception of aviation transport, maritime, and basic telecommunications. The agreement also provides intellectual property rights protection in a variety of areas including patent, trademark, and copyrighted material. The government procurement provisions of the NAFTA apply not only to goods but to contracts for services and construction at the federal level. Additionally, U.S. investors are guaranteed equal treatment to domestic investors in Mexico and Canada.

It is divided into the following subsections: common export documents, transportation documents, export compliance documents, certificates of origin, other certificates for shipments of specific goods, other export-related documents, and temporary shipment documents. Learn more about export documentation. \r\n Commercial Invoice \r\n A commercial invoice is a bill for the goods from the seller to the buyer. These invoices are often used by governments to determine the true value of goods when assessing customs duties. Governments that use the commercial invoice to control imports will often specify its form, content, number of copies, language to be used, and other characteristics. \r\n Export Packing List \r\n Considerably more detailed and informative than a standard domestic packing list, an export packing list lists seller, buyer, shipper, invoice number, date of shipment, mode of transport, carrier, and itemizes quantity, description, the type of package, such as a box, crate, drum, or carton, the quantity of packages, total net and gross weight (in kilograms), package marks, and dimensions, if appropriate. Both commercial stationers and freight forwarders carry packing list forms. A packing list may serve as conforming document. It is not a substitute for a commercial invoice. In addition, U.S. and foreign customs officials may use the export packing list to check the cargo. \r\n Pro Forma Invoice \r\n A pro forma invoice is an invoice prepared by the exporter before shipping the goods, informing the buyer of the goods to be sent, their value, and other key specifications. It also can be used as an offering of sale or price quotation. \r\n TRANSPORTATION DOCUMENTS \r\n Airway Bill \r\n Air freight shipments require airway bills. Airway bills are shipper-specific (i.e., USPS, Fed-Ex, UPS, DHL, etc.). \r\n Bill of Landing \r\n A bill of lading is a contract between the owner of the goods and the carrier (as with domestic shipments). For vessels, there are two types: a straight bill of lading, which is non-negotiable, and a negotiable or shipper's order bill of lading. The latter can be bought, sold, or traded while the goods are in transit. The customer usually needs an original as proof of ownership to take possession of the goods. See also: straight bill of lading and liner bill of lading. \r\n Electronic Export Information Filing (formerly known as the Shipper’s Export Declaration) \r\n Electronic Export Information (EEI) is the most common of all export control documents. It is required for shipments above $2,500* and for shipments of any value requiring an export license. It has to be electronically filed via the AES Direct online system, which is a free service from Census and Customs. \r\n Numerous videos are available on AES Direct, including: Registering for AESDirect, Filing a Shipment in AESDirect, Response Messages from AES, Proof of Filing Citations , AESDirect - The Shipment Manager, and Elimination of the SSN in the AES. \r\n *Note: The EEI is required for shipments to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the former Pacific Trust Territories even though they are not considered exports (unless each \"Schedule B\" item in the shipment is under $2,500). \r\n Shipments to Canada do not require an EEI except in cases where an export license is required. (Shipments to third countries passing through Canada do need an EEI.) \r\n EXPORT COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTS \r\n Export Licenses \r\n An export license is a government document that authorizes the export of specific goods in specific quantities to a particular destination. This document may be required for most or all exports to some countries or for other countries only under special circumstances. Examples of export license certificates include those issued by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (dual use articles), the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (defense articles), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (nuclear materials), and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (controlled substances and precursor chemicals). \r\n Several videos are available on export licenses, including: Export Compliance Introduction, Exporting Commercial Items: ECCNs and EAR99, The Commerce Control List and Self-Classification, and Exporting EAR99 Items: Screening Your Transaction, Lists to Check and Red Flags. \r\n Destination Control Statement \r\n A Destination Control Statement (DCS) is required for exports from the United States for items on the Commerce Control List that are outside of EAR99 (products for which no license is required) or controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). A DCS appears on the commercial invoice, ocean bill of lading, or airway bill to notify the carrier and all foreign parties that the item can be exported only to certain destinations. For more information, watch relevant videos: Export Compliance Introduction, and Exporting Commercial Items: ECCNs and EAR99. \r\n CERTIFICATES OF ORGIN \r\n Generic Certificate of Origin \r\n The Certificate of Origin (CO) is required by some countries for all or only certain products. In many cases, a statement of origin printed on company letterhead will suffice. The exporter should verify whether a CO is required with the buyer and/or an experienced shipper/freight forwarder or the Trade Information Center. \r\n Note: Some countries (i.e., numerous Middle Eastern countries) require that certificate of origin be notarized, certified by local chamber of commerce and legalized by the commercial section of the consulate of the destination country. For certain Middle Eastern countries, the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of Commerce may also provide such services. \r\n For textile products, an importing country may require a certificate of origin issued by the manufacturer. The number of required copies and language may vary from country to country. \r\n Certificate of Origin for claiming benefits under Free Trade Agreements \r\n Special certificates may be required for countries with which the United States has free trade agreements (FTAs). Watch our FTA webinar for more information. Some certificate of origin including those required by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the FTAs with Israel and Jordan, are prepared by the exporter. Others including those required by the FTAs with Australia; the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) countries; Chile; and Morocco; are the importer’s responsibility). Click on a specific country below to learn details on how to document origin. \r\n  Australia (CO samples) \r\n Bahrain (importer to check with Govt. of Bahrain on format/information) \r\n CAFTA-DR (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras CO sample) \r\n Chile (CO sample) \r\n Israel (CO sample Note: The green form needs to be purchased from Vendor or US-Israel Chamber of Commerce or a publishing house.) \r\n Jordan (notarized generic certificate of origin required) \r\n Morocco (importer makes a claim on the basis of supporting evidence) \r\n NAFTA (CO sample and relevant videos) \r\n Singapore (No certificate of origin is required. However, the importer is required to produce the necessary permits together with an invoice, at the time of cargo clearance.) \r\n Peru (There is no prescribed format. However, specific information is required. See implementing instructions and sample certification guidance for Peru. \r\n Korea (There is no prescribed format. However, specific information is required. See documenting origin guidance and required data elements for certification for Korea. \r\n  Certificate of Origin for goods not manufactured in the United States \r\n Certificates of origin for goods not manufactured in the United States can be obtained from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce uses EZCertOrigin™, a service provided by ICS Consulting, LLC, to process all requests submitted for certificates of origin (both U.S. and non-U.S.). Exporters can visit EZCertOrigin or call 1-888-885-6650 to obtain the forms required by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and detailed instructions on how to fill out the forms. The fee for each certificate is $40.00 for U.S. Chamber members. The fee for each certificate is $150.00 for non-U.S. Chamber of Commerce members. It costs $5.00 per copy for certified copies of certificates. \r\n OTHER CERTIFICATES FOR SHIPMENTS OF SPECIFIC GOODS \r\n Additional certificates are needed for different purposes. Check with your importer, freight forwarder, or contact the Global Knowledge Center for more information. \r\n ATA CARNET/Temporary shipment certificate \r\n An ATA Carnet, a. k. a., \"Merchandise Passport,\" is a document that facilitates the temporary importation of products into foreign countries by eliminating tariffs and value-added taxes (VAT) or the posting of a security deposit normally required at the time of importation. Apply for an ATA Carnet. \r\n Certificate of Analysis \r\n A certificate of analysis can be required for seeds, grain, health foods, dietary supplements, fruits and vegetables, and pharmaceutical products. \r\n Certificate of Free Sale \r\n Certificate of free sale may be issued for biologics, food, drugs, medical devices and veterinary medicine. More information is available from the Food and Drug Administration. Health authorities in some states as well as some trade associations also issue Certificates of Free Sale. \r\n Dangerous Goods Certificate \r\n Exports submitted for handling by air carriers and air freight forwarders classified as dangerous goods need to be accompanied by the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods required by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The exporter is responsible for accuracy of the form and ensuring that requirements related to packaging, marking, and other required information by IATA have been met. \r\n For shipment of dangerous goods it is critical to identify goods by proper name, comply with packaging and labeling requirements, which vary depending upon the type of product shipper and the country shipped to. More information on labeling/regulations is available from the International Air Transportation Association or Department of Transportation - HAZMAT websites. \r\n For ocean exports, hazardous material regulations are contained in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods regulations. \r\n Fisheries Certificate \r\n The National Marine Fisheries Service conducts inspections and analyses of fishery commodities for export. \r\n Fumigation Certificate \r\n The Fumigation Certificate provides evidence of the fumigation of exported goods (especially agricultural products, used clothing, etc.). This form assists in the quarantine clearance of any goods of plant or animal origin. The seller is typically required to fumigate the commodity at his or her expense a maximum of 15 days prior to loading. \r\n Halal Certificate \r\n Required by most countries in the Middle East, this certificate states that the fresh or frozen meat or poultry products were slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. Certification by an appropriate chamber and legalization by the consulate of the destination country is usually required. \r\n Health Certificate \r\n For shipment of live animals and animal products (processed foodstuffs, poultry, meat, fish, seafood, dairy products, and eggs and egg products). Note: some countries require that health certificates be notarized or certified by a chamber and legalized by a consulate. Health certificates are issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). \r\n Ingredients Certificate \r\n A certificate of ingredients may be requested for food products with labels that are inadequate or incomplete. The certificate may be issued by the manufacturer and must give a description of the product, contents, and percentage of each ingredient; chemical data; microbiological standards; storage instructions; shelf life; and date of manufacture. If animal fats are used, the certificate must state the type of fat used and that the product contains no pork, artificial pork flavor, or pork fat. All foodstuffs are subject to analysis by Ministry of Health laboratories to establish their fitness for use. \r\n Inspection Certificate \r\n Weight and Quality certificates should be provided in accordance with governing USDA/GIPSA regulations for loading at port and loading at source/mill site as appropriate. A certificate of origin certified by the local chamber of commerce at the load port and a phytosanitary certificate issued by APHIS/USDA and fumigation certificate are to be provided to the buyer. Costs of all inspection, as well as certificates/documents at the load port, are usually the responsibility of the seller. Independent inspection certificates may required in some instances. \r\n Pre-Shipment Inspections \r\n The governments of a number of countries have contracted with international inspection companies to verify the quantity, quality, and price of shipments imported into their countries. The purpose of such inspections is to ensure that the price charged by the exporter reflects the true value of the goods, to prevent substandard goods from entering the country, and to deflect attempts to avoid payment of customs duties. Requirements for pre-shipment inspection are normally spelled out in letter-of-credit or other documentary requirements. Inspections companies include Bureau Veritas, SGS and Intertek. Some countries require pre-shipment inspection certificates for shipments of used merchandise. \r\n Insurance Certificate \r\n Insurance certificates are used to assure the consignee that insurance will cover the loss of or damage to the cargo during transit. These can be obtained from your freight forwarder or publishing house. Note: an airway bill can serve as an insurance certificate for a shipment by air. Some countries may require certification or notification. \r\n Phytosanitary Certificate \r\n All shipments of fresh fruits and vegetables, seeds, nuts, flour, rice, grains, lumber, plants, and plant materials require a federal phytosanitary certificate. The certificate must verify that the product is free from specified epidemics and/or agricultural diseases. Additional information and forms are available from Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). \r\n Radiation Certificate \r\n Some counties including Saudi Arabia may require this certificate for some plant and animal imports. The certificate states that the products are not contaminated by radioactivity. \r\n Other (Product-Specific) Certificates \r\n Shaving brushes and articles made of raw hair must be accompanied by a recognized official certificate showing the consignment to be free from anthrax germs. Used clothing requires a disinfection certificate. Grain requires a fumigation certificate, and grain and seeds require a certificate of weight. Many countries in the Middle East require special certificates for imports of animal fodder additives, livestock, pets, and horses. \r\n Weight Certificate \r\n A certificate of weight is a document issued by customs, certifying gross weight of the exported goods. \r\n OTHER EXPORT-RELATED DOCUMENTS \r\n Consular Invoice \r\n Required in some countries, a consular invoice describes the shipment of goods and shows information such as the consignor, consignee, and value of the shipment. If required, copies are available from the destination country's embassy or consulate in the U.S. The cost for this documentation can be significant and should be discussed with the buyer. \r\n Canadian Customs Invoice \r\n Although not required by regulation, this customs invoice is a preferred document by Canadian Customs and customs brokers. It is issued in Canadian dollars for dutiable and taxable exports exceeding $1600 Canadian dollars. Detailed invoice requirements can be obtained at the Canadian Customs website. \r\n Dock Receipt and Warehouse Receipt \r\n A dock receipt and warehouse receipt are used to transfer accountability when the export item is moved by the domestic carrier to the port of embarkation and left with the ship line for export. \r\n Import License \r\n Import licenses are the responsibility of the importer and vary depending upon destination and product. However, including a copy of an import license with the rest of your documentation may in some cases help avoid problems with customs in the destination country. \r\n ISPM 15 (Wood Packaging) Marking \r\n The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade (ISPM15) is one of several International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures adopted by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC). The IPPC is an international treaty to secure action to prevent the spread and introduction of pests of plants and plant products, and to promote appropriate measures for their control. The American Lumber Standard Committee (ALSC) and the National Wooden Pallet and Container Association (NWPCA) provide phytosanitary certification for wood packaging materials (WPM). APHIS will issue a phytosanitary certificate for wood package materials only if WPM are the cargo. \r\n Shipper’s Letter of Instruction \r\n The shipper’s letter of instruction is issued by the exporter to the forwarding agent and includes shipping instructions for air or ocean shipment. \r\n TEMPORARY SHIPMENT DOCUMENTS \r\n ATA CARNET/Temporary shipment certificate \r\n An ATA Carnet, a. k. a., \"Merchandise Passport,\" is a document that facilitates the temporary importation of products into foreign countries by eliminating tariffs and value-added taxes (VAT) or the posting of a security deposit normally required at the time of importation. Apply for an ATA Carnet. \r\n Customs Certificate of Registration \r\n Customs Form 4455 may be used (often in conjunction with a temporary import bond or ATA Carnet for goods that are leaving the United States on a temporary basis for alteration, repair, replacement, and processing). \r\n Transporting Goods by Truck to Canada \r\n An application to transact bonded carrier and forwarding operation, Form E370, is required to bring goods over the border to Canada, when not already cleared through Customs at the border.

INCOTERMS® -- which is an abbreviation for International Commercial terms -- is a series of sales terms. They are published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and are widely used in commercial transactions. In addition to providing a set of rules for the interpretation of commonly used trade terms, INCOTERMS® 2010 accomplish the following: \r\n  Significantly revises Group D listed in INCOTERMS® 2000 \r\n Reduces Incoterms from four groups to two groups, allowing trade experts to choose the most suitable rule related to the mode of transport \r\n Reduces the absolute number of Incoterms from 13 to 11. \r\n  Moreover, INCOTERMS® 2010 offers additional guidance which assists users in selecting the most appropriate Incoterm for each transaction. The revised terms also spell out rules regarding the use of electronic procedures; detail information on security-related clearances for shipments; and offer advice with respect to domestic trade. \r\n Learn more about INCOTERMS® 2012 \r\n Schedule B and HS Numbers \r\n The Harmonized System (HS) assigns a 6-digit number to each product that is traded internationally. Each country can assign, on its own, four additional numbers, making the entire number 10 digits. The United States does this with its Schedule B system. \r\n Tariffs and Import Fees \r\n Tariffs or duties are a tax levied by governments on the value of products imported from one country into another. Before you export to any country, you need to determine what the tariff rate is on your product(s) as well as any import fees for that country. \r\n Common Export Documents \r\n There are many common export documents that have to accompany export shipments including the Shipper’s Export Declaration, invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin… and the list goes on.

The simplest, most definitive way is to request an advance ruling from the Korean Customs Authority -- however, this may incur additional costs and can take up to 90 days for Korean Customs to make a determination after the full application has been received. Provided here are a series of steps that should get you reasonably close. \r\n The first step is to look up your U.S. Schedule B classification. This serves two purposes. The first is that it may be required on your export documentation. Secondly, the initial six-digits (referred to as the HS Code) will tend to be, if not the same, in the same neighborhood as your product's classification in the Korean tariff schedule and its listing in the KORUS Rules of Origin Annex. Since HS Codes are largely standardized from country-to-country, identifying your product's HS Code under the U.S. Schedule B puts you well on the path to finding your product's classification in Korea. However, despite this standardization, it is ultimately up to the Korean Customs Service to determine how your product will be classified. For example, what would be the classification of a security device that combines a flashlight, pepper spray and an alarm? The U.S. Customs Service classified this as a flashlight, but the Korean Customs Service might view it as an alarm. \r\n To find your Schedule B classification, we recommend starting with the U.S. Census Bureau's Schedule B database. This plain language tool, where you can enter \"laptop\" instead of \"portable digital automated data processing machine,\" helps you discover the probable U.S. Schedule B for your product. \r\n For Example \r\n The U.S. Schedule B classification for laptop computers is 8XXX.XX.XXXX. The first six digits of the Schedule B is the HS Code. For laptops the HS code is 8471.30. Learn more about Tariff and Import Fees. \r\n Enter the first six-digits of your product's U.S. Schedule B classification (the HS Code), into the FTA Tariff Tool with \"FTA Partner\" set to \"Korea.\" This will pull up all the 10-digit tariff subsidiary codes that form part of that six-digit heading, in order. Looking at all the results that start with the same six digits will show you how Korea sub-divides your product's HS Code when assigning tariff rates. You will need to determine whether your product is likely covered by the product descriptions attached to one of those tariff lines or, if not elsewhere specified, under the sub-heading catch all of \"other.\" The 10-digit code in the first column should be your product's tariff classification in the Korean Harmonized Tariff Schedule. From the results page in the FTA Tariff Tool, click on View Details to see the FTA-negotiated preferential tariff rate (FTA rate) and phase-out schedule for your product. Remember your HS Code too, as that is relevant for determining the appropriate rule of origin for your product. \r\n U.S. – Korea FTA Tips \r\n The FTA Tariff Tool only includes the FTA rates for industrial products. Agricultural and textile and apparel products should be added in the near future. In the meantime, the Customs Info Database or Korean Tariff Schedule, can provide current FTA rates. \r\n Sometimes it is helpful to review the official harmonized tariff schedule structure to understand how it is organized. \r\n Although an importer and/or freight forwarder can provide the likely tariff classification, use the Korean Customs Service to ensure your classification is correct. \r\n Advantage to claiming preferential treatment \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ","pub_date":"2013-01-22","title":"U.S. – Korea Free Trade Agreement: Determine Your Product's Tariff Classification","update_date":"2014-02-26","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["Korea (South)"]},{"id":"245","content":" Rules of Origin \r\n Identify the Rule of Origin under KORUS \r\n The rules of origin define which products qualify for the FTA–negotiated preferential tariff rate (FTA rate) under KORUS. \r\n Broadly speaking, products that are originating in either the United States or Korea are eligible for the FTA rate – although only the Korean Customs Service can definitively make a determination about FTA eligibility for imports into Korea. A product is originating under KORUS if it is a) wholly obtained or produced entirely in the United States or Korea, b) produced entirely in the United States and Korea and each of the non-originating materials (inputs) that are part of the good (product) being exported have met the relevant product–specific rule of origin; or c) produced entirely in the U.S. or Korea from originating materials (inputs). A simplistic illustration of this might be a wooden chair, which to be originating could be a) made in the United States from U.S. wood; b) made in the United States from Argentine wood, but because the wood has been transformed into a chair, it now meets the rule of origin for a chair; or c) made in the United States from Korean wood. \r\n Product specific rules are listed by HS Code in Annex 6-A of the Agreement or Annex 4-A (textiles and apparel). If your product is produced in the United States or Korea and contains non-originating inputs (non-US and non-Korean content, including content from an unknown origin), you will need to look at the specific rule of origin for your product to determine whether it is originating under KORUS. There is a limited de minimis exception (Article 6.6) available for most products where the non-originating inputs do not exceed 10 percent of the adjusted value of the product. However, there are restrictions on this exception for various agricultural products (listed in Annex 6-B) and a different rule applies for textiles and apparel products (Article 4.2.7). \r\n Although rules of origin under KORUS differ by product, they typically fall within three general categories, consisting of: \r\n  A change in tariff classification (tariff-shift) \r\n A regional value-content requirement (RVC) \r\n A combination of change in tariff classification and regional value content \r\n  Documenting Origin \u0026amp; Keeping Records \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ","pub_date":"2013-01-22","title":"U.S. \u0026ndash; Korea Free Trade Agreement: Identify the Rule of Origin under KORUS","update_date":"2013-01-23","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["Korea (South)"]},{"id":"246","content":" Documenting Origin \r\n It is the responsibility of the importer in Korea to make a claim for the FTA-negotiated preferential tariff rate (FTA rate) for qualifying products.

Please note that the Korean Customs Service does not mandate a specific Certificate of Origin document under KORUS, nor is there a prescribed form or format for certifying origin. U.S. exporters or producers should be advised that as long as you provide the elements necessary to complete a certification, you should not need to use the Korean Customs Service’s sample Certificate of Origin or any Korean Government prescribed form, although you are free to do so. \r\n Note: In accordance with the terms of your business arrangement, your importer may request that you provide the certification information in a particular form or format. \r\n The certification may be completed based on the producer's or exporter's knowledge that the product is originating; or for the exporter, reasonable reliance on the producer's written or electronic certification that the product is originating. \r\n The language used on the certification may be in either English or Korean, although the importer may be asked to submit a translation into the local language. \r\n On some occasions, even if your importer will not claim the FTA tariff, they may ask you to provide information that documents the origin of your product. \r\n Keeping your Records \r\n Retain information and documents proving origin for a minimum of five years from the date of importation. Such records include: \r\n  Purchase, cost, value of, and payment for the exported product \r\n The purchase, cost, value of, and payment for all materials, including recovered goods, used in the production of the final product \r\n The production of the final product in the form in which it was exported \r\n  U.S. – Korea FTA Tips \r\n The certification may only be issued by the exporter, manufacturer, or importer; third party certificates (e.g., Chamber of Commerce) will not be accepted.

Since there are time and record-keeping costs associated with claiming eligibility of your product for the FTA rate, it is always a good idea to double check the current MFN tariff rate and compare it to the FTA rate. \r\n There are three resources that will have pieces of the information you need: the FTA Tariff Tool shows you the FTA rate, including for future years, while the Customs Info Database and Korean Tariff Schedules show you the current Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rates. \r\n Note:The Korean Tariff Schedule is tool requires you to have all 10-digits (without punctuation). Additionally, the Korean 10-digit code is not necessarily the same as the U.S. Schedule B Code, so make sure not to use the U.S. Schedule B Code! \r\n Compare the FTA rate to the MFN rate to determine whether there is an advantage to claiming FTA tariff treatment. As long as the MFN rate is equal to or lower than the FTA rate, there may be no real advantage to spending the time and effort to determine if your product qualifies for the FTA rate. However, if the FTA rate is lower, then you should determine if your product may qualify for the FTA rate. To do so, you will need to determine if your product is originating under KORUS. \r\n U.S. – Korea FTA Tips \r\n Although most tariffs were eliminated under KORUS on March 15, 2012, the tariffs on some products will phase-out over time. Where applicable, the new tariff rates will take effect on January 1st of each year. The FTA Tariff Tool provides you the ability to see when the tariffs on your product phase-out. \r\n For U.S. origin products to enter Korea under the preferential tariff rate, the importer must submit a claim for the FTA rate. This may be done by submitting a certification of origin or an importer attestation. \r\n On some occasions, even if there is no difference between the FTA and MFN tariff rates, your importer may ask you to provide information that documents the origin of your product. \r\n Identify the Rule of Origin under KORUS \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;  ","pub_date":"2013-01-22","title":"U.S. – Korea Free Trade Agreement: Advantage to Claiming Preferential Treatment","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"247","content":" These videos presented by the U.S. Census Bureau: \r\n What is a Freight Forwarder?

Tariffs on the rest of those products will be phased out over ten years. To be eligible for tariff-free treatment under the TPA, products must meet the relevant rules of origin. \r\n Under the Agreement, the Parties are significantly liberalizing trade in goods and services. CAFTA-DR also includes important disciplines relating to: customs administration and trade facilitation; technical barriers to trade; government procurement; investment; telecommunications; electronic commerce; intellectual property rights; transparency; and labor and environmental protection. CAFTA-DR creates new commercial opportunities for the United States while promoting regional stability, economic integration, and economic development for an important group of U.S. neighbors. \r\n The CAFTA-DR region was the 15th largest U.S. export market in the world in 2010, and the third largest in Latin America behind Mexico and Brazil.

Like the regular IBP service, the core value proposition of IBP Select is that the U.S. Commercial Service recruits pre-screened international buyers to U.S. trade shows to meet with U.S suppliers exhibiting at those shows. The main difference between IBP and IBP Select is that IBP offers worldwide promotion and recruitment whereas Select focuses on promotion and recruitment in no more than five international markets. \r\n Differences between IPB and IPB Select \r\n  IBP Select Service is a great value for smaller shows (under 1,200 exhibitors/under 20,000 attendees), shows that are ready to make the strategic shift and focus on international attendance, and shows that are in niche/specialty sectors. \r\n IBP Select is essentially the same service as the regular IBP, except: \r\n  Recruitment of foreign buyer delegations is limited to 5 delegations \r\n CS staffing at the venue will be 2 Global Teams members versus 1 IBP Project Officer and 2 Global Teams members. (The IBP Office will still handle all administrative aspects of the IBP, e.g., MOA, cost recovery, etc.) \r\n Price is $5,000 versus $9,800 \r\n Show organizer only provide 900 square feet for the International Business Center versus 1,600 square feet \r\n  IBP-recruited delegates would continue to receive either waived or significantly reduced admission to the event. \r\n Delegation leaders recruiting a minimum of 10 delegates would be eligible for a complimentary hotel room. \r\n   ","pub_date":"2013-02-01","title":"International Buyer Program: Select Service","update_date":"2013-03-21","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["International Buyer Program","Matchmaking Services"]},{"id":"259","content":" Trade Shows: Connecting to International Companies \r\n The comparative advantage of the IBP versus other B2B matchmaking service offerings is it enables U.S. companies to meet a breadth of prospective buyers from around the world all in one domestic venue. Given this, there is significant demand from U.S. trade show organizers to participate in the IBP. Between 2010 and 2012, the percentage of repeat IBP applicants exceeded 60 percent, indicating strong customer satisfaction among our trade show organizer clients. To participate in the IPB program, contact an Export Assistance Center. \r\n U.S. Companies and Exhibitors \r\n Your chances of finding the right international business partner greatly increases when you exhibit at a trade show that’s part of the IBP.

Here are some other legal issues: \r\n Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) \r\n U.S. firms seeking to do business in foreign markets must be familiar with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In general, the FCPA prohibits American companies from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The Department of Justice is the chief enforcement agency, with a coordinate role played by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Commerce Department's Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce (OCC-IC) has posted useful background information on various legal issues facing exporters -- focusing mostly on export and investment issues. \r\n Anti-Boycott Regulations \r\n The United States has an established policy of opposing restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries friendly to the United States. In general, these laws prohibit U.S. persons from participating in foreign boycotts or taking actions that further or support such boycotts. The laws are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security. \r\n Anti-Dumping \r\n If a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it normally charges on its own home market, it could be said to be \"dumping\" the product. Opinions differ as to whether or not this is unfair competition, but many governments take action against dumping in order to defend their domestic industries. The World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement does not pass judgment. Its focus is on how governments can or cannot react to dumping -- it disciplines anti-dumping actions, and it is often called the \"Anti-Dumping Agreement.\" (This focuses only on the reaction to dumping contrasts with the approach of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement.) \r\n Other Legal Resources \r\n District Export Councils \r\n District Export Councils (DECs) are organizations of leaders from the local business community, whose knowledge of international business provides a source of professional advice for local firms. Many DEC members are practicing attorneys. For more than 25 years, DECs have served the U.S. by assisting companies in their local communities export. \r\n American Bar Association \r\n Another useful source for legal information is the American Bar Association (ABA). The ABA publishes numerous books on the subject of international business. Some of these publications include guides to the legal aspects of doing business in specific countries and guides to foreign law firms and law groups abroad. \r\n Additional Resources \r\n  Find an Export Assistance Center \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-02-05","title":"Legal Considerations ","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"264","content":" Accurate, up-to-date market intelligence is essential for your company to target the best international market opportunities and make informed business decisions when evaluating potential overseas business partners. \r\n You can leverage the knowledge and resources of the U.S. government by tapping into our vast network of experts, contacts and partners in 80 countries across the globe to get world-class market intelligence. \r\n Customized Market Research \r\n We can assess the market potential of your product/ services in a given market and prepare a report according to your specific business needs. \r\n  Identify and evaluate key market dynamics, opportunities and challenges \r\n Address your particular questions regarding the market for your products/services \r\n  Learn more about the customized market research program. \r\n Reports on Potential Overseas Business Partners \r\n We can investigate the capabilities, legitimacy, and financial strength of a potential overseas business partner and provide useful information gleaned from government, industry and financial contacts, the local press, and other sources. \r\n Learn more about the international company profile service to receive financial reports on companies in over 800 countries. \r\n Additional Resources \r\n  Approaches for finding and assessing markets overseas \r\n Get business overviews in more than 120 countries and profiles of 110 industry sectors \r\n Introduction to trade data and analysis \r\n Webinars on new markets and industry information \r\n Webcasts: International business \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-02-11","title":"Market Research and Due Diligence","update_date":"2013-11-12","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":["Market Intelligence"],"subtopic":["Market Research"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"266","content":"  Austria \r\n Hungary \r\n Poland \r\n Belgium \r\n Iceland \r\n Portugal \r\n Bulgaria \r\n Ireland \r\n Romania \r\n Cyprus \r\n Italy \r\n Slovakia \r\n Czech Republic \r\n Latvia \r\n Slovenia \r\n Denmark \r\n Liechtenstein \r\n Spain \r\n Estonia \r\n Lithuania \r\n Sweden \r\n Finland \r\n Luxembourg \r\n Switzerland \r\n France \r\n Malta \r\n Turkey \r\n Germany \r\n Netherlands \r\n United Kingdom \r\n Greece \r\n Norway \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-03-07","title":"Countries That Require CE Marking","update_date":"2013-03-08","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"267","content":" The following overviews contain information on common directives. \r\n \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT -

The purpose of the directive is to ensure the essential health and safety requirements of cableway installations designed to carry persons. Chapter I, Article 1 describes installations and products subject to the directive. \r\n The installations concerned are: \r\n  Funicular railways and other installations with vehicles mounted on wheels or on other suspension devices where traction is provided by one or more cables \r\n Cable cars where the cabins are lifted and/or displaced by one or more carrier cables; this category also includes gondolas and chair lifts \r\n Drag lifts, where users with appropriate equipment are dragged by means of a cable \r\n  The directive applies to: \r\n  Installations built and put into service, as from its entry into force \r\n Subsystems and safety components placed on the market, as from its entry into force. \r\n  PHASE 2: CE Marking Requirements for the Cableway Installations Designed to Carry Persons Directive \r\n Article 3 stipulates that installations and their infrastructure, subsystems and safety components of the installation must comply with the essential requirements laid out in Annex II. They are presumed to comply with the relevant essential requirements whenever the manufacturer decided to use a harmonized European standard as referenced in the Official Journal of the European Communities. \r\n Testing carried out by \"notified bodies\" or their affiliates is required for safety components (Chapter II) and subsystems (Chapter III). Notified bodies are companies which have been selected by the EU member states and \"notified\" to the European Commission as being competent to test and certify products under a particular directive where third party testing is required. Notified bodies must be located in the EU and are the only entities allowed to give final product approval under directives requiring the CE marking, although their affiliates outside the EU are allowed to test products and send results to the parent for approval. \r\n Each member state lays down procedures for authorizing the construction and the putting into service of installations (Chapter IV). The safety analysis, the EC declarations of conformity and the accompanying technical documentation relating to the safety components and subsystems must be submitted by the main contractor or his authorized representative to the authority responsible for approving the installation.

For many exporters, their seaports are their nexus to the global economy. This makes them ideal partners in your effort to learn how to expand your global sales and your market presence worldwide. \r\n Over 95% of the world’s consumers are located outside the United States. To help you reach them, President Obama created the National Export Initiative, a government-wide effort to double America’s exports by the end of 2014 to support millions of jobs here at home. \r\n Please register below to access the Federal export assistance resources available to you. These resources will help you expand your business and reach vast new markets. With our help, and the help of your local port, you’ll be growing your export business in no time. \r\n America’s export growth relies on our ability to focus and leverage all available export promotion resources to help U.S. companies succeed in the global marketplace. By working together to do so, we can achieve the export growth, job creation, and national economic recovery and development goals that are at the heart of President Obama’s National Export Initiative. \r\n Our new Partnership was launched on July 19, 2011, in a ceremony led by Under Secretary for International Trade Francisco J.

The overview references key websites relating to the Low Voltage Directive (2006/95/EC), an updated list of standards for the Low Voltage Directive, and instructions on how to certify for the directive. This document also provides information on where standards can be purchased, and presents a list of labs around the country that can do CE marking testing for the Low Voltage Directive. \r\n Please Note: The CE mark can only be applied to a product once the manufacturer can declare compliance with all applicable directives. \r\n PHASE 1: Does the Low Voltage Directive Apply to Your Product? \r\n The purpose of the Low Voltage Directive is to ensure the safety of people, domestic animals, and property by protecting them against hazards caused by electrical equipment. Manufacturers must ensure protection against hazards stemming from the electrical equipment by addressing factors such as temperature, arcs and radiation. Insulation must be suitable for the conditions of use. The manufacturer must also offer protection from hazards arising from external influences on the electrical equipment such as mechanical, chemical, fire, electromagnetic frequency (EMF) or thermal risks. \r\n In effect the essential requirements of the Low Voltage Directive state that electrical equipment within the scope of the directive should not endanger persons, domestic animals or property when the equipment is properly installed, maintained and used in applications for which it was made. \r\n All electrical equipment designed for use with a voltage rating between 50 and 1000 volts for alternating current (AC) or between 75 and 1500 volts for direct current (DC) are covered by the Low Voltage Directive. Voltage ratings refer to the voltage of the electrical input or output, not to voltages which may appear inside the equipment. \r\n Generally speaking, products that must comply with the Low Voltage Directive are electrical consumer products or capital goods that are designed to operate within these voltage limits. Examples are: \r\n \r\n  electrical appliances and hand-held electrically driven tools;  \r\n lighting equipment including ballasts; \r\n switch gear and control gear; \r\n electric wiring; \r\n appliance couplers and cord sets; \r\n electrical installation equipment; \r\n cable management systems \r\n  \r\n Battery-operated equipment outside the voltage rating is naturally outside the scope of the Low Voltage Directive. However, accompanying battery-chargers, as well as equipment with integrated power supply units within the voltage ranges of the Directive, are within the scope of the LVD. This applies also to battery-operated equipment with a supply voltage rating under 50 V AC and 75 V DC, with accompanying mains power supply units (e.g. notebooks). So when the notebook and power supply unit are distributed together, they both need to meet the CE mark requirements for the Low Voltage Directive, even if the notebook has a battery-powered voltage under the range of the LVD. (The notebook would also have to meet the CE mark requirements for the EMC Directive). \r\n Additionally, the Low Voltage Directive applies to products for which the European Commission has mandated a Low Voltage Harmonized Standard. For the list of Low Voltage Harmonized Standards, please consult the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org/. --\u0026gt;New Approach Standardisation in the Internal Market and click on “Directives and Standards.” Then, click on the box entitled “References Harmonized Standards” in the column marked Low Voltage Equipment. \r\n Annex II of the Low Voltage Directive lists the following equipment as being outside the scope of directive: \r\n \r\n  Electrical equipment for use in a potentially explosive atmosphere; \r\n Electrical equipment for radiology and medical purposes; \r\n Electrical parts for goods and passenger lifts (elevators); \r\n Electricity meters; \r\n Plugs and socket outlets for domestic use; \r\n Electric fence controllers; \r\n Radio-electric interference; and, \r\n Specialized electrical equipment for use on ships, aircraft or railways which complies with the safety provisions drawn up by international bodies in which the Member States participate. \r\n  \r\n The products listed in Annex II above are excluded from the Low Voltage Directive because they are regulated under national laws, international agreements, or other New Approach Directives. \r\n For information on which components need to be certified for the Low Voltage Directive, please refer to the NIST booklet entitled, \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ts.nist.gov/europe. --\u0026gt;“A Guide to the EU Low Voltage Directive” . It is generally accepted that components such as transformers and electrical motors should be CE-marked. Components such as those should also undergo a further assessment of the safety aspects related to their incorporation into the final product. Other components such as integrated circuits, transistors, diodes, triacs, and passive components such as capacitors, inductors, resistors and filters do not fall within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive and do not need to be CE-Marked. \r\n PHASE 2: CE Marking Requirements for the Low Voltage Directive \r\n The essential requirements of the Low Voltage Directive are contained in Annex I of the Directive. The essential requirements describe the safety objectives of the directive in terms of general conditions, protection against hazards arising from electrical equipment, and protection against hazards that may be caused by external influences on the electrical equipment. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory. \r\n A manufacturer can self-certify to the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive by conforming to the European standards that apply to its product. The manufacturer must get a test result either in house or from a lab, in order to prove product conformance to the appropriate European harmonized low voltage standard(s). Manufacturers can use either an independent lab or a third party lab affiliated with an EU notified body. The list of these standards can be found on the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org/. --\u0026gt;European Commission’s website by clicking on “Directives and Standards” and then clicking on “References Harmonized Standards” across from the Low Voltage Directive. Compliance with the harmonized standards gives assurance to the manufacturer that the product tested meets the essential requirements of this directive. \r\n A manufacturer is not required to use European standards to comply with the Low Voltage Directive. If the manufacturer does not use European standards, then the company will have to indicate in its technical file what solutions it used to meet the requirements of the directive. \r\n PHASE 3: Identify the European Standards for the Low Voltage Directive that Apply to Your Product \r\n The Low Voltage Directive sets down rules for the use of standards for gaining CE marking approval. Article 5 states that application of European “harmonized” standards (developed by a European standards-setting body and recognized by the Commission and Member States as EU wide standards) will give the presumption of conformity for CE marking requirements for the Low Voltage Directive. If there are no harmonized standards for the manufacturer’s product, then Member States should recognize international standards, such as those developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). In the absence of harmonized European or international standards, Member State authorities should accept national standards in effect in the Member State of manufacture; or from the U.S. exporter’s point of view, Member State authorities should recognize national standards used by a U.S. company in the Member State receiving the product. \r\n Manufacturers are not required to use harmonized European standards, but if they do not, then they bear the burden of proof that they have met the requirements of the directive. Article 8 cautions the manufacturer: “In the event of a challenge, the manufacturer or importer may submit a report, drawn up by a body, which is notified…” In other words, in the event of a challenge, a manufacturer using standards which do not carry a presumption of conformity might be well advised to enlist the aid of a notified body or one of the notified body’s U.S. branches. \r\n If a company chooses to use the European harmonized standards, its technical staff should go through the list of standards and identify the standards that apply to its product, and order those standards from a designated outlet, some of which are listed in the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.export.gov/cemark/eg_main_017270.asp. --\u0026gt;Consultants/Ordering Standards. \r\n In general, the standards for the Low Voltage Directive can be divided into seven major categories: safety of households and similar electrical appliances; safety of machinery; safety of handheld electrical tools; safety of information technology equipment; safety of household electronic appliances; luminaries (lighting); and safety requirements for electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use. \r\n PHASE 4: Conform to the Appropriate Standards \r\n Once the company has ordered and received the appropriate European standards (possibly from the list under the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.export.gov/cemark/eg_main_017270.asp. --\u0026gt;Consultants/Ordering Standards), its engineering or technical department can apply the standards to the design and production phase of its product. The standards contain all the detailed information, diagrams, and tests necessary to meet the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive. The directive is general in scope, stating that people, property, and animals must be protected from: \r\n \r\n  hazards arising from electrical equipment;  \r\n hazards caused by external influences such as mechanical dangers and chemical dangers; and  \r\n risks to health caused by noise, vibrations, or ergonomic factors \r\n  \r\n The detailed information (and diagrams) of what is actually required to meet the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive is found in the European standards. \r\n PHASE 5: Get a Lab Test to Prove Conformance to the Low Voltage Standards \r\n Once a company has chosen the standards for the Low Voltage Directive, it will need a lab result to prove that the standards have been met. For a list of labs that can do testing and certification for the Low Voltage Directive, see the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.export.gov/cemark/eg_main_017274.asp. --\u0026gt;Testing/Certifying Labs. This list is not an endorsement for any particular laboratory. There are other labs, not listed on our link that can do testing for the Low Voltage Directive. \r\n If you have used European standards, you can self-certify for the Low Voltage Directive. Indicate to the lab that you only need a test result verifying the European standards you have used. The lab charges more for assessing the product, applying the standards, and producing a test result than it will for producing only a test result showing conformance to the European standards. As long as the manufacturer has conformed to European standards, it can get a test result from any lab that has the equipment to test to the standard. The manufacturer can go to an EU-affiliate lab or to an independent lab. In fact, if the company has the equipment to test to European standards, it can do the testing in-house. \r\n After a product has successfully passed the tests, the manufacturer needs to obtain a certificate from the lab showing the product has met standards for the Low Voltage Directive. Together with the Quality Control system, this certificate will form the core of the company’s technical file (see PHASE 7). \r\n PHASE 6: Set up a Quality Control System \r\n The manufacturer is obligated to set up a quality control system to ensure that products it produces in the future will also meet CE mark requirements for the Low Voltage Directive, the same as the manufacturer’s original CE-marked product documented in the technical construction file. The manufacturer can design its own quality control system. This system does not have to be ISO 9000, though ISO 9000 is widely recognized and could be advantageous for marketing purposes. \r\n In addition to ensuring that products manufactured are similar to the type tested sample, compliance with LVD standards exists requiring production units to be subjected to routine production line tests such as Electric Strength (Hipot) and Protective Earth Resistance tests to ensure that all units manufactured have an adequate insulation system and a reliable protective earth connection. Results and details of the tests should be logged against the product serial number and retained as a Quality Record. \r\n PHASE 7: Assemble a Technical File \r\n The manufacturer is required to compile a technical file that must contain the following: \r\n \r\n  A general description of the electrical equipment; \r\n Conceptual design and manufacturing drawings and schemes of components, subassemblies, circuits, etc.; \r\n Descriptions and explanations necessary for the understanding of said drawings and schemes and the operation of the electrical equipment; \r\n A list of the standards applied in full or in part, and descriptions of the solutions adopted to satisfy the safety aspects where standards have not been applied; \r\n Results of design calculations made, examinations carried out, etc; and, \r\n Test reports (from the manufacturer or a third party). \r\n  \r\n The manufacturer or its authorized representative must keep a copy of the declaration of conformity (see PHASE 9) with the technical documentation. Also, the manufacturer should refer to the details of its quality control system in the technical file. The significance of the quality control system is described in PHASE 6. \r\n Annex IV of the Low Voltage Directive states that the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community must keep a copy of the technical file on Community territory at the disposal of the relevant national authorities for inspection purposes for a period of at least 10 years after the last product has been manufactured. \r\n Where neither the manufacturer nor his authorized representative is established within the Community, this obligation is the responsibility of the person who places the electrical equipment on the Community market. \r\n   \r\n PHASE 8: Affix the CE Marking to Your Product \r\n Annex III of the Low Voltage Directive has a picture of the CE mark. To view this picture, go to the website \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org/. --\u0026gt;New Approach Standardisation in the Internal Market, click on “Directives and Standards” and then click on 2006/95/EC under Low Voltage Equipment. Then, click on the pdf section of the square marked EN for English. The CE mark must be indelibly affixed to a product. It does not have to be branded onto a product but it must be affixed so that it will not come off. The two letters (CE) must have the same vertical dimension, which may not be less than 5 millimeters in height. If your product is covered by more than one CE marking directive (such as by the Machine, Electromagnetic Compatibility, and Low Voltage Directives), then it is assumed that the CE marking will not be put on the product until CE marking requirements have been met for all the directives the manufacturer’s product falls under. Annex III also states that if the CE marking is reduced or enlarged, the proportions given in the drawing in Annex III must be respected. \r\n PHASE 9: Declaration of Conformity  \r\n The declaration of conformity is the document showing that the manufacturer, or his authorized representative, has met the requirements of all applicable CE marking directives for the product being placed on the EU market. The declaration of conformity could accompany each shipment to show EU customs authorities that the imported product meets CE mark requirements. The declaration of conformity then goes to the customer who keeps it on file in case EU authorities have questions about the compliance and origin of the product. A company official from the U.S. manufacturer must sign the declaration of conformity to show that the firm is backing its claim of meeting CE marking requirements. \r\n For a sample declaration of conformity, go to the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.export.gov/cemark/eg_main_017272.asp. --\u0026gt;Declaration of Conformity Example. There is no mandatory format for the declaration of conformity; however, general guidance is given in Draft Certif 2005 -2 from European Commission references EN 45014:1989 \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/pdf/sogs_n506_draft_certif_2005_2_version2.pdf. --\u0026gt;“General criteria for suppliers’ declaration of conformity.” \r\n However, the declaration of conformity must include the following pieces of information according to Annex III of the Low Voltage Directive: \r\n \r\n  name and address of the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community; \r\n description of the electrical equipment (including model and serial number); \r\n reference to the harmonized standards; \r\n where appropriate, references to the specifications with which conformity is declared; \r\n identification of the signatory who has been empowered to enter into commitments on behalf of the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community; \r\n the last two digits of the year in which the CE marking was affixed.  \r\n  \r\n Phase 10: Keep Posted on Updates of Standards Which Might Affect Your Product \r\n The European Union issues new low voltage standards periodically. U.S. companies complying with the CE marking for the Low Voltage Directive should check the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org/. --\u0026gt;European Commission’s website once every 4-6 months to see if new standards have been issued that might apply to their product. These new standards usually have a lead time of a couple of years, giving companies time to conform to the new requirements, which usually contain requirements and/or information additional to that in the standards they replaced. Once the new standard is published in the Official Journal, it is usually accompanied by a “Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of the superseded standard “DOCOPOCOSS, after which the old standard no longer gives presumption of meeting CE marking requirements. A company that has not stayed current and fails to comply with a new standard is technically in violation of the CE marking requirements and could be prosecuted by EU authorities. \r\n More Information is Available: \r\n If you need more information on getting the CE marking for the Low Voltage Directive, call either of the Department of Commerce EU specialists: Bob Straetz at 202-482-4496 in the Office of the European Union (OEU) or Sylvia Mohr at 011-32-2-508-2675 at the U.S. Mission to the EU, Brussels, Belgium. \r\n \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.buyusa.gov/europeanunion. --\u0026gt;Consult the U.S. Commercial Service website. \r\n Duquesne University Center for International Regulatory Assistance partially funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Market Development Cooperator Program of the U.S. Department of Commerce, has \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.citra.duq.edu/. --\u0026gt;information on CE marking. \r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_END_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt;\r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- Code Added to have buyusa home pages move to export.gov --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- New Code Ended --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"Overview of the CE Marking Process for the Low Voltage Directive","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"293","content":" Applications for the 2013 President’s E-Awards will be accepted between November 5, 2012 and January 21, 2013.

The European Commission does not publish a list of products to which their laws apply; they require the manufacturer to determine the applicability of directives to any given product. The purpose of the Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels directive is to assure that appliances burning gaseous fuels used for cooking, heating, hot water production, refrigeration, lighting or washing and having, where applicable, a normal water temperature not exceeding 105 degrees Celsius, and fittings as defined in Article 1 of the directive, are placed on the market and put into service only when they do not compromise the safety of persons, domestic animals and property when they are used normally. Chapter I, Article 1 of the directive describes products to which the directive applies. \r\n Phase 2: CE Marking Requirements for the Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels Directive \r\n The Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels Directive sets out the essential requirements for approval of these appliances in Annex I of the directive. General Conditions in the annex state that the appliances must be designed and built as to operate safely and present no danger to persons, domestic animals or property when used in a normal fashion. Materials used must be appropriate for their intended purpose and must withstand the technical, chemical and thermal conditions to which they will likely be subjected. Appliances must be designed and constructed so that no instability, distortion, breakage or wear is likely to impair their safety when used in a normal fashion. Member states shall presume compliance with the essential requirements when the appliances and fittings conform to national and harmonized standards as indicated in Article 5 of the directive. Annex II concerns means of certification of conformity with the required standards. \"Notified bodies\" are responsible for carrying out the certification of conformity. Certification of series-manufactured appliances are subject to the EC type-examination as referred to in Section 1, Annex II of the directive, while appliances produced in single units or small quantities may be verified as indicated in Section 6 of Annex II. After completion of the conformity certification, the CE marking of conformity is to be affixed to the conforming appliances in accordance with Article 10. \r\n Manufacturers of Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels are NOT permitted to self-certify the compliance of their products. The U.S. manufacturer must hire a testing lab affiliated with a notified body; test results are subsequently sent to the notified body for evaluation and approval, following which the notified body issues a certificate. (Notified bodies are companies which have been selected by the EU member states and \"notified\" to the European Commission as being competent to test and certify products under a particular directive where third party testing is required. Notified bodies must be located in the EU and are the only entities allowed to give final product approval under directives requiring the CE marking, although their affiliates outside the EU are allowed to test products and send results to the parent for approval.) \r\n The U.S. Government has NOT negotiated a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) in the Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels sector. \r\n To view the Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels Directive and see the latest list of standards for that directive, please go to the European Commission's website at http://www.newapproach.org and click on \"directives and standards.\" ","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"Appliances Burning Gaseous Fuels","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"274","content":" The following technical file procedures refer only to procedures set forth in the directives that do not require intervention by notified bodies. \r\n Although each directive specifies the content of the technical file, further details concerning the extent, content and form of the information supplied are needed to ensure better exploitation of the technical file by the national inspection authorities and to facilitate the manufacturer's task at the drafting stage. \r\n Format and Contents of the Technical File \r\n In Decision 90/683/EEC of 13 December 1990 the Council established that \"the essential objective of a conformity assessment procedure is to enable the public authorities to ensure that products placed on the market conform to the requirements as expressed in the provisions of the directives, in particular with regard to the health and safety of users and consumers\". \r\n This guideline from the Council is, therefore, the essential criterion to be taken into account when considering the content and extent of the information to be supplied in the technical file provided for in the directives, i.e. the content and extent of the obligation to provide information. \r\n Consequently, the details included in the technical file always depend on the nature of the product and on what is necessary, from the technical point of view, to demonstrate the conformity of the product either to the harmonized standards, if the manufacturer has followed them, or to the essential requirements of the relevant directive if the manufacturer has followed none or only some of the harmonized standards. This must, therefore, be determined case by case depending on the product. \r\n To allow effective exploitation of this file for market surveillance purposes, excessive paperwork should be avoided. To achieve this and to facilitate the manufacturers' task, it is proposed that the inspection authorities should accept subdivision of the file into two parts. \r\n 1. The first part (A) would consist of a summary of the essential technical data relevant to the conformity assessment procedures, including in particular: \r\n  he name and the address of the manufacturer and the identification of the product; - the list of harmonized standards followed by the manufacturer and/or the solutions adopted to satisfy the essential requirements; - a description of the product; - the operating instructions, if any; - the overall plan of the product, if any. \r\n  2. The second part (B) would consist of a full file containing all the test reports, information concerning the quality manual, plans, descriptions of the products and processes, standards applied, etc. \r\n If the manufacturer fails to follow this two-part breakdown of the technical file, the inspection authorities could demand the full technical file or part thereof according to the requirements for inspection purposes, unless the details given in the declaration of conformity or in the certificate of conformity appear sufficient for the purposes of conducting a preliminary inspection. \r\n Availability of the Technical File  \r\n The technical file must be kept at the disposal of the national authorities for inspection and control purposes. With certain exceptions, this obligation to keep at least one technical file inside the territory of the Community starts at the time of the placing the product on the Community market whatever the geographical origin of the product. \r\n This obligation is incumbent upon the manufacturer or his representative established in the Community. \r\n If the manufacturer is not established in the Community and has no representative in the Community, the person who places the product on the Community market must take on this obligation. \r\n Any person responsible for placing a product on the Community market but not in possession of the technical file must be capable of: \r\n \r\n  where the technical file is situated inside the Community; \r\n the technical file as soon as possible on request from the national authorities. \r\n  \r\n However, the name and address of the person in possession of the file need not be expressly mentioned on the product or on its packaging, unless otherwise specified. \r\n The file cannot be requested systematically. In general, it can be requested only during checks made for market surveillance purposes by the Member States. \r\n In any event the request for the technical file must remain in proportion to the requirements of the inspection carried out. Therefore in general the manufacturer or person responsible for placing a product on the Community market should initially provide the inspection authorities with only a summary of the essential technical data (part A of the technical file). One or more specific points of the second part can nevertheless be requested in cases of serious doubt about the conformity of the product to the Community regulations. \r\n The full technical file can only reasonably be requested where necessary and certainly not when only an individual point is to be checked, in which case only the relevant part of the file should be required. \r\n If the competent authorities in the Member State request the technical file, the first part of the technical file (part A) should be made available immediately, allowing a reasonable time for transmission. Extra time should be granted for submission of the second part (part B) of the file, taking into account its volume and form (written, computerized...). \r\n Community-wide organization of the market surveillance procedures and coordination of the inspections should avoid repeated submission of the same technical file by the same manufacturer to different inspection authorities. The technical file must be kept for at least ten years from the last date of manufacture of the product, unless the directive expressly provides for any other duration. \r\n Language of the Technical File \r\n If the Community directives contain no specific provisions concerning the language of the file, the requirements of the Member States must be assessed on the basis of Article 30 of the EEC Treaty on a case by case basis, taking into consideration the proportionality of their demands. A Member State may request presentation of the first part of the technical file (part A) in its official language but should not do so if the national authorities can understand the file or its contents in the other language. Where a translation is required the person in possession of the file will be allowed extra time to submit the first part of the file to the inspection authorities. \r\n Moreover, no further conditions may be imposed concerning this translation, such as a requirement of a translator accredited or recognized by the public authorities, or of official translators or other similar requirements. \r\n Confidentiality \r\n Decision 90/683/EEC (Annex I.i) stresses the need to ensure the legal protection of confidential information. No exceptions can be made to this very important principle which the Member States must observe strictly. To this end, Member States must ensure that everyone involved in the assessments, inspections and surveillance and who has knowledge of the contents of the technical file is bound to professional secrecy. \r\n Precise rules will, where necessary, have to be laid down by the Member States to guarantee this confidentiality. This applies in particular to the bodies notified by the Member States, which must ensure that these bodies maintain this confidentiality. \r\n Confidentiality is also mentioned in the EN 45000 series of standards which serve as the reference standards for the notification of bodies by the Member States. \r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_END_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt;\r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- Code Added to have buyusa home pages move to export.gov --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- New Code Ended --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"CE Marking -- Technical File Procedures","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"327","content":" Webinar - Working with USTDA and Energy Sector Contracting Opportunities for U.S. Companies \r\n February 25, 2013 \r\n Description: The U.S. Trade and Development Agency held a free webinar on contracting opportunities within the energy sector, including current and upcoming activities. The presentation slides and audio recording are now available online. \r\n   \r\n Webinar - Saudi Arabia's Electricity Market and Opportunities for Smart Grid Exporters \r\n January 31, 2012 \r\n Description: Saudi Arabia offers abundant opportunities to U.S. companies that can provide the technologies and services necessary to meet growing electricity demand and contribute to the Saudi government's ambitious plans to improve energy efficiency.

The European Commission (EC) does not publish a list of products to which their laws apply; they require the manufacturer to determine the applicability of directives to any given product. The Directive 90/384/EEC, Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments, defines a weighing instrument as “a measuring instrument serving to determine the mass of a body by using the action of gravity on that body. A weighing instrument may also serve to determine other mass-related magnitudes, quantities, parameters, or characteristics.” A non-automatic weighing instrument is defined as “a weighing instrument requiring the intervention of an operator during weighing.” This Directive applies to all non-automatic weighing instruments. \r\n A distinction is made in this Directive between non-automatic weighing instruments for the “determination of mass for commercial transactions” and all other non-automatic weighing instruments. The complete list of weighing instruments for commercial transactions is listed in Article 1.2(a) of this Directive. Automatic weighing instruments listed in Article 1.2(a) must meet the requirements listed in Annex I of this Directive. It is also important to remember that products that are subject to the Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments Directive may also be subject to other EU Directives.

For additional information on this directive, please contact either of the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU Specialists: Bob Straetz at 202-482-4496 or Sylvia Mohr at 011 32 2 508 2675. \r\n PHASE 2: CE Marking Requirements for the Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments Directive \r\n The Directive 90/384/EEC, Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments, is a codified list of standards that manufacturers of products falling under this Directive must meet to import their products into the European Union. The CE Marking is the mark that indicates that a product has met the minimum health, environmental, and safety requirements listed in the Directive. If a product requires a CE Marking, the requirement applies equally to all products sold in Europe regardless of the country of origin. \r\n The Directive 90/384/EEC, Non-Automatic Weighing Instruments, does not allow for CE Marking self-certification. Non-automatic weighing instruments listed in Article 1.2(a) must satisfy the “essential requirements” specified in Annex I of this Directive for CE Marking certification. Devices connected to the weighing instrument that are not used for the tasks listed in Article 1.2(a) are not subject to the “essential requirements” listed in Annex I. \r\n The conformity to the requirements specified in Annex I of the Directive can be certified by either of the listed procedures below. Both methods of conformity require the use of a notified body for certification. A notified body is a testing facility that has met the requirements set forth in the Directive, and is licensed by the EU Member State in which it is based to verify conformity of applicable products. \r\n An EC type examination followed by either an EC declaration of type conformity (a guarantee of production quality) or by EC verification. According to Annex II.1 of the Directive, an EC type examination consists of a notified body verifying and certifying a representative sample of a product meets the Directive requirements that apply to that product. The complete text and requirements for an EC declaration of type conformity are located in Annex II.2 and in Annex II.3 of the Directive for EC verification. \r\n EC unit verification is the process of a notified body “checking and attesting” that a product, designed for a specific application, meets the applicable requirements listed in the Directive. The complete text for EC unit verification is located in Annex II.4 of the Directive. \r\n A list of approved testing facilities is published in the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando. --\u0026gt;Official Journal of the European Communities along with their identification numbers and the tests that each lab is approved to conduct.

After May 1, 2005, when the standard for industrial, commercial, and residential garage doors (EN 13241-1) goes into effect, those products will require CE marking under the Construction Products Directive. In addition, industrial, commercial and residential garage doors will have to continue to meet CE marking requirements for the Machinery Directive (as they were required to in the past). If the garage doors are powered, manufacturers will have to continue to meet CE marking requirements for the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and Low Voltage Directives. The EMC and Low Voltage Directives have been mandatory for a number of years for makers of electrically-powered garage doors. The manufacturer should affix the CE marking to its product only after meeting the requirements of all the directives the product falls under. \r\n How is the CE marking obtained? \r\n In the case of the Construction Products Directive, a manufacturer obtains the CE marking by meeting the requirements in EN 13241-1. The chart in Table ZA.3 entitled “Assignation of evaluation of conformity tasks for non fire/smoke doors under system 3\" lists the characteristics that manufacturers have to meet. The top part of the chart shows what the manufacturer can do on his own: 1.) Factory production control (FPC) and 2.) Initial type testing (ITT) for geometry of glass and mechanical resistance. The bottom two-thirds of the chart shows tasks for the notified body to complete. Under system 3, the notified body (a testing laboratory) must perform the initial type tests for: Water tightness; release of dangerous substances; resistance to wind load; thermal resistance; air permeability; durability of water tightness, thermal resistance and air permeability; safe opening; and operating forces. Manufacturers are responsible for selecting representative samples for the product that is placed on the market. \r\n Some EU member states do not require all those characteristics. However, at least one EU member state does require one of those characteristics. Therefore, in order for a manufacturer planning to sell throughout the European Union to be sure of meeting CE marking requirements for all member states, all the initial type tests for the characteristics given in the second list above must be met. This requires the assistance of a notified body. \r\n The notified bodies perform tasks such as testing, inspection, and certification and issue the relevant documents such as test reports and certificates which the manufacturer needs in order to determine the product’s performance and to complete his technical file. In all cases, the manufacturer signs the declaration of conformity and decides to apply CE marking to his products. In this case (attestation of conformity system 3), the notified body only performs tests. \r\n There are a number of supporting standards referenced in EN 13241-1, such as EN 12604, EN 12444, EN 12424, and EN 12453. Use of supporting standards may be necessary in order to enable a manufacturer to meet the requirements of EN 13241-1. The complete list of supporting standards for garage doors is listed in EN 13241-1. \r\n What standards/directives govern the obtaining of a CE marking? \r\n In most CE marking directives, a manufacturer can, but does not have to, use European standards to show compliance with the CE marking directive applying to his product. Use of European standards does confer a presumption of conformity to CE marking requirements. However, in the case of the Construction Products Directive, if there is a harmonized standard issued for a product (such as EN 13241-1 for garage doors), then the manufacturer has to comply with that standard in order to affix the CE marking. The manufacturer of a garage door, which is manually powered, also must meet the requirements of the Machinery Directive in addition to meeting requirements of the Construction Products Directive. \r\n A harmonized standard is one that has been approved by European Union Member States and has been published in the EU’s Official Journal. Some of the clauses in a harmonized standard are commercially or technically useful in making a product, but are not deemed relevant to the directive. The harmonized clauses (which are requirements) in EN 13241-1 are referenced in Annex Z. Any other clauses are voluntary. \r\n A company that makes electrically-powered garage doors must meet requirements for the Low Voltage and Electromagnetic Compatibility Directives, in addition to meeting provisions of the Construction Products and Machinery Directives. \r\n A company could self-certify for the EMC, Low Voltage, and Machinery Directives, meaning it does not need to get a test report or certificate from a notified body. As part of the self-certification process, however, a company would need to get a test from a lab to prove it had conformed to the appropriate European standards for the EMC and Low Voltage directive. \r\n A garage door manufacturer could meet the CE marking requirements for the Machinery Directive by doing a safety analysis report covering the essential health and safety requirements in Annex I that apply to garage doors. \r\n A safety analysis report involves identifying applicable hazards in Annex I and then indicating how these hazards were eliminated. If the hazards weren’t eliminated, then the manufacturer must warn people of the residual risks. \r\n Is the CE Marking mandatory, or will it become mandatory? What countries are involved in the enforcement of the CE marking? \r\n Garage doors have been covered by the Machinery Directive since that directive went into effect in 1995. Electrically-powered garage doors are covered by the Machinery Directive as well as by the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (since 1996) and the Low Voltage Directive (since 1997). When EN 13241-1 becomes mandatory on May 1, 2005, manufacturers will have to meet the requirements of that standard, which makes CE marking for the Construction Products Directive mandatory. In addition, manufacturers must continue to meet CE marking requirements for the Machinery Directive and if applicable, the Low Voltage and EMC directives. \r\n The countries involved in the enforcement of the CE marking are the 27 European Union countries, as well as Turkey, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. \r\n If the CE Marking will become mandatory, when is the effective date? \r\n EN 13241-1 becomes mandatory on May 1, 2005. Manufacturers will have to meet CE marking requirements for the Construction Products Directive at that time, since EN 13241-1 is a harmonized standard (approved by the European Union Member States), mandated under the Construction Products Directive. Garage door manufacturers will need a test report from a notified body (or more than one) showing they met CE marking ITT requirements for EN 13241-1, and this will involve a laboratory test by an EU-affiliate lab. There are some EU-affiliate labs located in the U.S. (See question 7). \r\n What scope of products are covered? Garage doors and rolling doors? With and without operators? Residential, Commercial, and Industrial? \r\n The scope of EN 13241-1 states: “This European standard specifies the safety and performance requirements for doors, gates, and barriers, intended for installation in areas in the reach of people, for which the main intended uses are giving safe access for goods and vehicles accompanied or driven by persons in industrial, commercial and residential premises. \r\n This standard also covers commercial doors such as rolling shutters and rolling grilles when used as doors on retail premises which are mainly provided for the access of persons rather than vehicles or goods. \r\n These doors may include pass doors incorporated in the door leaf which are also covered by this standard. \r\n These devices may be manually or power operated. \r\n This standard does not cover operation in environments where the electromagnetic disturbances are outside the range of those specified in EN 61000-6-3.” \r\n EN 13241-1 then lists doors which are excluded from its scope. Those exclusions include: \r\n \r\n  Block gates and dock gates; \r\n doors on lifts; \r\n doors on vehicles; \r\n armored doors; \r\n doors mainly for the retention of animals; \r\n theater textile curtains; \r\n horizontally moving manually operated doors with a leaf size less than 6.25 m2; \r\n horizontally moving power operated doors less than 2.5 m wide and 6.25 m2 area, designed principally for pedestrian use in accordance with prEN 12650-1:2001: \r\n revolving doors of any size; \r\n railway barriers; \r\n barriers used solely for vehicles. \r\n  \r\n This standard does not cover the radio part of doors. If a radio operating device is used, the relevant ETSI standards should be applied in addition. \r\n This European standard does not cover fire resistance or smoke control characteristics which are covered in prEN 13241-2. \r\n This standard does not cover specific requirements regarding noise emitted by a door in relation with the Machinery Directive. \r\n This standard does not contain any specific requirement for doors which are moving because of energy stored by dedicated means from human power such as manually tensioned springs. \r\n This standard does not contain any specific requirements for doors on escape routes. The ability to open the door leaf safely and easily cannot normally be achieved by industrial, commercial and garage doors due to size, weight and/or mode of operation. \r\n In summary, EN 13241-1:2001 deals with the safety and performance requirements for doors and gates in an industrial, commercial or residential environment. The doors and gates must ensure the safe passage of goods and vehicles accompanied by people. Roll-down shutters that are used as a door or gate are also covered by the standard. The products covered by the standard can be both manually and power operated. In addition, EN 13241-1:2001 lists a series of supporting standards. \r\n Where does a manufacturer go to obtain the CE marking? \r\n Annex Z defines the attestation system which applies in the conformity assessment for EN 13241-1:2001. The two tasks that a manufacturer has to perform are: Factory production control (FPC) and initial type testing (ITT). The attestation level for EN 13241-1:2001 is 3. Level 3 means that: \r\n The manufacturer must establish and maintain an internal factory production control that complies with Article 6.4 of the standard. The manufacturer can do this on his own without having to go to a notified body. The chart in Annex Z also shows that the manufacturer can perform Initial type testing on his own for geometry of glass and mechanical resistance. \r\n The manufacturer must get a test report from a notified body covering all other initial type tests listed in Annex Z. These characteristics requiring a notified body test report are: Water tightness; release of dangerous substances; resistance to wind load; thermal resistance; air permeability; durability of water tightness, thermal resistance and air permeability; safe opening; and operating forces. Notified bodies use samples supplied by the manufacturer for their evaluations and then compile a report. \r\n Manufacturers of garage doors will need to contact a notified body or a laboratory affiliated with a notified body to obtain CE marking. The Commerce Department has identified several places where garage door companies can get CE marking testing, inspections, and certificates: \r\n British Standards Institute at XXX-XX-XXXX-230442, contact Chris Lewis; \r\n TUV Rheinland of North America at 919-554-3668, contact Bill Ronzio. \r\n Intertek Testing Services at 1-800-967-5352 or 608-836-4400 \r\n Other UK certification organizations are: \r\n \r\n  Warrington Fire Research \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.warringtonfire.net/. --\u0026gt;http://www.warringtonfire.net/ \r\n Chiltern Fire Research \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.chiltern.co.uk/. --\u0026gt;www.chiltern.co.uk \r\n BRE \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.bre.co.uk/. --\u0026gt;www.bre.co.uk \r\n  \r\n For more information on notified bodies, consult the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando/. --\u0026gt;EC’s Nando-CPD database and click on nando-CPD, then click on enter, then click on notified bodies in the box on the left hand side. \r\n To find the notified bodies that have been specifically authorized to issue certificates for EN 13241-1, go to the nando-CPD website, click on enter, then click on standards in the box on the left hand side. Go down the page until you get to EN 13241-1 and click on it. A list of notified bodies named to do testing for EN 13241-1 will appear. \r\n Where does a manufacturer go to obtain sufficient data, i.e., testing/engineering? \r\n The technical data for meeting requirements can be found in standard EN 13241-1. EN 13241-1 also lists supporting standards which contain technical information. The notified body lab that the manufacturer decides to work with can also provide advice on obtaining data. \r\n Who is responsible for overseeing the requirements for the CE Marking? \r\n In one sense, the notified body would oversee requirements for the CE marking because its report indicates that CE marking requirements for characteristics referred to in question 7 have been met. If this question is referring to enforcement of the CE marking, then that is up to the Member States. Member States enforce CE marking directives through active surveillance (by inspecting shops and construction works), through control at the borders, and finally by passive surveillance (usually sending an inspector to the site of a complaint). \r\n Who is responsible for developing the content of the standards/directives associated with the CE marking? \r\n Directives are proposed by the European Commission, then sent to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers for review and finally approved by the Council of Ministers (representatives of the Member States). During a preliminary stage, before the directive is drafted, the Commission hears reports from various committees on reasons why a directive is needed and on what the content of the directive should be. European industry’s views are heard at this stage. Industry (including European, U.S., Asian) has often lobbied the European Parliament and the Commission to change a directive. Sometimes industry’s points are taken, sometimes they aren’t. \r\n Once a directive has been adopted, the European Commission will mandate the European standards organizations, either CEN, CENELEC, or ETSI, to produce standards enabling companies to meet the safety requirements for the CE marking directive in question. European companies and trade associations are actively involved with committees in developing EU standards. U.S. companies and other non-EU firms have very limited input into EU standards produced by CEN or CENELEC. If a U.S. firm has a manufacturing plant in the EU, then it can participate in the standards-setting process. U.S. firms can make comments on EU draft standards through the American National Standards Institute, but there is no guarantee European standards groups will accept these comments. Non-EU firms with no manufacturing presence in the EU are at a disadvantage in having any say in the development of EU standards for most New Approach (ie, CE marking) directives. ETSI has a more liberal policy as far as letting non-EU companies participate in the standards-setting process for the Radio and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive. \r\n \r\n  CEN European Committee for Standardization \r\n CENELEC European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization \r\n ETSI European Telecommunications Standards Institute \r\n  \r\n What role do the Door \u0026amp; Shutter Manufacturers Association (DSMA) and the European Door and Shutter Federation play in influencing both requirements for the CE marking and the content of the standards/directives? \r\n The British Door and Shutter Manufacturers Association (DSMA) along with the European Door and Shutter Federation (EDSF) have been involved in working parties that have developed the standards for garage doors. Each member country has a representative on the committee. The trade associations mentioned above sit on these committees and in some cases hold chairmanships, so they play a key role in developing standards. \r\n DSMA plays a role because it is represented in the BSI (British Standards Institution) committee for doors. BSI is a voting member of CEN and sends delegates (who have generally been DSMA nominees) to CEN meetings. Although DSMA strongly influences how BSI will vote on a particular issue, views of other national organizations (representing for example architects and consumers) are taken into account. EDSF is a liaison member of CEN TC/33 and cannot vote as such. \r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_END_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt;\r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- Code Added to have buyusa home pages move to export.gov --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- New Code Ended --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"DASMA Questions on the Construction Products Directive and Garage Doors","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"290","content":" \r\n In a time when millions of Americans are out of work, boosting our exports is a short-term imperative.  Exports support millions of good, high-paying American jobs.

The President signed an \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-national-export-initiative. --\u0026gt;Executive Order instructing the federal government to use every available federal resource in support of this effort:  \r\n \r\n  by creating an Export Promotion Cabinet made up of the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, and other federal agencies responsible for exports. \r\n by re-establishing the President’s Export Council, the principal private sector advisory committee on international trade.  \r\n  \r\n Over the next several years: \r\n \r\n  We’ll continue significantly ramping up Export-Import Bank trade financing for businesses, especially small and medium businesses that want to export their goods but just need a boost.  \r\n We’re going to advocate for our workers, businesses and products abroad to make sure everyone knows what we already do – that the American workers are the most productive and dynamic in the world.  \r\n Secretary Clinton is creating a Senior Visitor Business Liaison in every one of our embassies to proactively look for export opportunities and provide advice to American companies.  \r\n We’ll help US companies identify and gain footholds in new and emerging markets overseas by setting up one-stop-shops that provide a comprehensive toolkit of services – from financing to counseling to promotion – to help potential exporters grow and expand.  \r\n Through employing new technologies and pursuing public-private partnerships, exporters can draw from the global shipping knowledge and resources of companies like FedEx, UPS and the US Postal Service.  \r\n We’ll enforce our current trade agreements and strengthen our existing relationships.  \r\n We’ll increase the government’s attention on removing barriers that are hampering US companies, because if we’re providing free and fair access to foreign markets, then we expect it in return. \r\n    \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"About the National Export Initiative","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":true,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["NEI"]},{"id":"288","content":" The U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration, along with the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, and a number of strategic regional partners, has developed a series of no cost, one day, international opportunities seminars.

This guide references key websites relating to the EMC Directive, features an updated list of European standards for the EMC Directive, and offers instructions on how to meet CE mark requirements for the directive. The document also provides information on where standards can be purchased and presents a list of labs around the country that can do CE marking. The EMC Directive 2004/108/EC became mandatory for products covered by its scope on July 20, 2009. \r\n Please note: The CE mark can only be applied to a product once the manufacturer can declare compliance with all applicable directives. \r\n PHASE 1: Does the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive Apply to Your Product? \r\n As a manufacturer, you need to secure copies of the directives and judge whether they apply to your product. The purpose of the EMC Directive is to have electronic or electrical products function properly when they are in proximity to other electronic and electrical products by a) ensuring that electrical and electronic products do not emit electromagnetic disturbances that will adversely affect other products; b) making the apparatus immune from incoming electromagnetic disturbances. \r\n The EMC Directive covers \"apparatus,\" \"components and sub-assemblies,\" and \"mobile installations.\" Apparatus means any finished appliance or combination of appliances made commercially available as a single functional unit which can generate electromagnetic disturbance or whose performance is affected by such disturbance. Components or sub-assemblies are intended for incorporation into an apparatus by the end user. They cannot generate emissions and must be immune from incoming emissions to ensure their intended performance. Mobile installations are defined as a combination of apparatus and where applicable, other devices, intended to be moved and operated in a range of locations. \r\n A component made by a supplier for installation into a final product may need CE marking. If the component can be sold commercially and used independently, such as electronic circuit boards, electric motors, or computer disc drives, then CE marking will be required. If the component has no direct function, then it does not need CE marking. Cables and cabling accessories, simple mechanical thermostats, and light-emitting diodes (LED) are examples of components that do not need CE marking. \r\n \"Fixed installations\" do not have to be CE marked although they do have to meet the requirements of the EMC Directive through sound engineering practices. Fixed installations are defined as a particular combination of several types of apparatus, and where applicable, other devices, which are assembled, installed, and intended to be used permanently at a predefined location. \r\n Examples of fixed installations found in the European Commission Guide on the EMC Directive (May 2007) include: \r\n  Industrial plants, power plants, power supply networks, telecommunication networks, cable TV networks, computer networks, airport luggage handling installations, airport runway lighting installations, automatic warehouses, skating hall ice rink machinery installations, storm surge barrier installations (with the control room etc.), wind turbine stations, car assembly plants, water pumping stations, water treatment plants, railway infrastructures, and air conditioning installations. \r\n  Fixed installations are not assessed by testing to harmonized standards as would be the case for individual pieces of equipment but: \r\n  Must still meet the essential protection requirements of the EMC Directive \r\n Must be installed applying good engineering practice \r\n Must have documentation prepared and held by the designated responsible person \r\n    For further informatinoi on EMC issues, review the European Commission's Guide to the EMC Directive and the EMC Quick Guide. \r\n PHASE 2: CE Marking Requirements for the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive \r\n The EMC Directive states that equipment shall be designed and manufactured, having regard to the state of the art, to ensure that: \r\n  The electromagnetic disturbance generated does not exceed the level which radio and telecommunications equipment or other equipment cannot operate as intended \r\n It has a level of immunity to the electromagnetic disturbance to be expected in its intended use which allows it to operate without unacceptable degradation of its intended use. \r\n  Manufacturers can use the internal production control described in Annex II to comply with the EMC Directive. The manufacturer shall perform an electromagnetic assessment on the product with the view of meeting the protection requirements listed above in points a and b. The manufacturer may want to identify the appropriate European standards from the list of EMC standards, order them, and demonstrate that they comply with the standards. Manufacturers can employ the services of an independent lab to show that a product meets the requirements of the relevant standards. Manufacturers must assemble a technical file which can be available to EU competent authorities. This technical file would include information such as the design of the product, the standards used, and the test certificate obtained from the lab proving conformance to the standards. \r\n The European Commission Guide to the EMC Directive (see link above) states that the EMC Directive excludes three types of equipment: \r\n  Radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment covered by Directive 1999/5/EC (The R\u0026amp;TTE Directive)\n \r\n Aeronautical products, parts, and appliances referred to in Regulation 1592/2003\n \r\n Radio equipment used by radio amateurs as defined in International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations\n \r\n  The Commission’s EMC Guide states that EMC requirements for certain products are covered within that specific product directive. For example, EMC requirements for the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC), the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (90/385/EEC), the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (98/79/EC), the Marine Equipment Directive (96/98/EC), the Agricultural and Forestry Tractors Directive (75/322/EEC), the Two or Three-Wheeled Motor Vehicles Directive (97/24/EC), and the Auto EMC Directive (95/54/EC) for parts that affect the safety of a vehicle are covered by requirements in those directives. As a result, products falling under those directives are not covered by the EMC Directive (2004/108/EC). \r\n PHASE 3: Identify the European Standards for the EMC Directive that Apply to Your Product \r\n While manufacturers are not required to use Harmonized European standards in certifying compliance with the EMC Directive, it is highly recommended as they will find it easier to self-declare or certify that their product meets the legislative requirements by using European standards. Other national, regional, or international standards can be used; however, the use of all applicable Harmonized European standards are preferred since they confer a presumption of conformity to the requirements of the EMC Directive when applied in full. These standards address the “essential requirements” contained in the EMC Directive. (Note: About 80 percent of the EU standards for the EMC Directive are taken directly from the International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) standards and just given a European prefix, so U.S. manufacturers are familiar with these standards.) \r\n As well as deciding which standards are the most relevant to its product, the manufacturer should consider where its products will be used. Products used in domestic environments generally have to meet more stringent emissions limits, but lower immunity levels than those used in industrial locations. \r\n To self-certify, examine the list of standards from the EMC Directive. Pick the standards that apply to your product, looking first for product specific standards which cover the vast majority of products, and if there aren’t any, then choose the generic EMC standards for emissions and immunity. EN 61000 6-4:2007 is the generic standard for emissions for industrial environments. EN 61000 6-2:2005 is the generic standard for immunity for industrial environments. There are also generic emissions and immunity standards for residential, commercial and light-industrial environments. \r\n The manufacturer should also examine the EMC standards on harmonics (EN 61000 3-2) and voltage fluctuation (EN 61000 3-3) for their possible applicability. Those standards affect many product areas, particularly information technology. The manufacturer would then order the standards he or she has decided are appropriate for the product. The Consultants/Ordering Standards line on the sidebar of this webpage lists sources for ordering standards. European standards are only available from an approved distributor and must be purchased. \r\n PHASE 4: Conform to the Appropriate Standards and Set Up a Quality System \r\n Once the company has ordered and received the appropriate European standards, its engineering or technical department can start applying the standards to the design and production phase of its product. The standards contain all the detailed information, diagrams, and tests that are necessary to meet the requirements of the EMC Directive. The directive is general in scope, saying that a product must not release emissions that could interfere with nearby electrical equipment and must also be immune from incoming emissions so that the product will function in its intended fashion. Typically, there should be at least two standards for the EMC Directive – one covering emissions and one for immunity. The details and specifics to meet the requirements of the directive are found in the European standards. \r\n A company will also need to set up a quality system to ensure that products manufactured in the future will meet CE mark requirements. This is important as the manufacturer is declaring that all products manufactured comply with the relevant directives and a suitable quality system can track in-life product changes and ensure that changes are not introduced without their effect on CE marking being properly considered, reviewed and documented. A company is not required to use a certain type of quality system. \r\n If a manufacturer does not use Harmonized European standards, or does not apply them in full, it will have to show the solutions it used to meet the requirements of the EMC Directive in its technical file. \r\n PHASE 5: Get a Lab Test to Prove Conformance to the EMC Standards \r\n Once a company has chosen the relevant standards for the EMC Directive, it will need a lab test to prove that the standards were met. For a list of labs that can do testing and certification for the EMC Directive, review the section on Testing/Certifying Labs. This list is not an endorsement for any laboratory. There are other labs, not listed on the link, that can do testing for the EMC Directive. \r\n In addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a list of labs on their website that has been designated as Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) under the mutual recognition agreement with the European Union. These labs can also do testing for CE marking requirements for the EMC Directive. The manufacturer can go to an EU-affiliate lab or an independent lab. If a company has the equipment to test to European standards, it can do its own testing in-house. \r\n A company can self-certify for the requirements of the EMC Directive by either using European standards or by using non-European standards. However, it is easier to demonstrate compliance with the EMC Directive by using European standards. The EMC Directive indicates that a product must meet emissions and immunity requirements but it does not say what the limits or values of those requirements are. The directive leaves that question up to the European standards. The European standards give the specific values for emissions and immunity for certain products which the directive does not give. \r\n Companies can use non-European standards, but the question about whether those standards provide the emissions and immunity values needed to comply with the EMC Directive is harder to gauge. European standards for EMC are geared specifically to meet the requirements of the EMC Directive. As mentioned earlier, about 80 percent of the European standards for the EMC Directive are derived from IEC standards and given European (EN) prefixes. U.S. companies are familiar with IEC standards. \r\n After a product has passed the testing, the manufacturer needs to obtain a certificate from the lab showing the product has met European standards for the EMC Directive. If the manufacturer did not use European standards, then the manufacturer must show that the solutions he has drawn up will meet the requirements of the EMC Directive. \r\n The onus is on the manufacturer to demonstrate that he meets the EMC Directive. The manufacturer may use guidance from test labs or other third parties, but it is the manufacturer who needs to explain how the standards chosen demonstrate compliance. \r\n The manufacturer does have the option of getting the product tested, approved, and certified at an EU notified body. \r\n PHASE 6: Assemble a Technical File \r\n The technical file must prove that the company has met the CE mark requirements for the EMC Directive. It must cover the design and manufacture of the apparatus by giving the following information: \r\n  A general description of the apparatus \r\n Evidence of compliance with the harmonized standards, if any, applied in full or in part \r\n •where the manufacturer has not applied harmonized (European) standards, or has applied them only in part, a description and explanation of the steps taken to meet the essential requirements of the Directive, including a description of the electromagnetic compatibility assessment set out in Annex II, point 1, results of design calculations made, examinations carried out, test reports, etc. \r\n A statement from the notified body, when the procedure referred to in Annex III has been followed \r\n  PHASE 7: Affix the CE Marking to Your Product \r\n A picture of the CE mark is shown in Annex V of the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (2004/108/EC). The CE marking must have a height of at least 5 mm. If the CE marking is reduced or enlarged, the proportions of the CE mark must be respected. The CE marking must be affixed to the apparatus or to its data plate. Where this is not possible or not warranted because of the nature of the apparatus, it must be affixed to the packaging, if any, and to accompanying documents. Once the manufacturer has met the requirements for all the CE marking directives that apply to his product, then the manufacturer makes up the CE marking and attaches it to each product. The manufacturer does not obtain the CE mark from a government agency in either the EU or US. If a product is covered by more than one CE marking directive (such as by the Machine, Electromagnetic Compatibility, and Low Voltage Directives), then it is assumed that the CE marking will not be put on the product until CE marking requirements have been met for all of the directives the manufacturer’s product falls under. \r\n PHASE 8: Create a Declaration of Conformity  \r\n The declaration of conformity is the document showing that the manufacturer has met CE marking requirements for the product being placed on the EU market. The declaration of conformity can accompany each shipment to show EU customs authorities that the imported product meets CE marking requirements. The declaration of conformity then goes to the customer who keeps it on file in case EU authorities have questions about the compliance and origin of the product. A U.S. company official from the manufacturer must sign the declaration of conformity to indicate that the firm is backing its claim of meeting CE marking requirements. The EMC Directive (2004/108/EC) states that the company filling out the declaration of conformity must list the standards it used to meet the requirements of the EMC Directive. \r\n Please note that Annex II of the EMC Directive, point 7, states that if neither the manufacturer nor the authorized representative is established within the European Community, then “the obligation to hold the EC declaration of conformity and the technical documentation at the disposal of the competent authorities shall lie with the person who places the apparatus on the Community market.” In other words, the company putting the product in service has to have quick access to the manufacturer’s technical file, whether by fedex or email, in the event EU competent authorities ask for the technical file. \r\n For a sample declaration of conformity, please see the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.export.gov/cemark/eg_main_017272.asp. --\u0026gt;Declaration of Conformity Example link on the sidebar of this page. There is no mandatory format for the declaration of conformity, however general guidance is given in Draft Certif 2005 – 2 from the European Commission referencing EN 45014:1989 ‘General criteria for suppliers’ declaration of conformity’: \r\n \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/pdf/sogs_n506_draft_certif_2005_2_version2.pdf. --\u0026gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/pdf/sogs_n506_draft_certif_2005_2_version2.pdf \r\n A declaration of conformity must include: \r\n \r\n  a reference to this Directive, \r\n an identification of the apparatus such as type, batch, and serial number, \r\n the name and address of the manufacturer and, where applicable, the name and address of his authorized representative in the Community, \r\n a dated reference to the specifications (ie, standards) under which conformity is declared to ensure conformity of the apparatus with the provisions of this Directive, \r\n the date of that declaration, \r\n the identity and signature of the person empowered to bind the manufacturer or his authorized representative \r\n  \r\n PHASE 9: Keep Posted on Updates of Standards Which Might Affect Your Product  \r\n The European Union reviews its directives regularly and issues new EMC standards periodically. U.S. companies complying with the CE marking for the EMC Directive should check the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org/. --\u0026gt;European Commission’s website once every 4-6 months to see if new standards have been issued that might affect their product. These new standards usually have a lead time of a couple of years, giving companies time to conform to the new requirements, which usually include additional tests, performance monitoring criteria or extending test frequency ranges beyond those in the standards they replaced. Once the new standard is published in the Official Journal, it is usually accompanied by a “Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of the superceded standard” (DOCOPOCOSS) after which, the old standard no longer gives presumption of meeting CE mark requirements. A company that has not stayed current and fails to adopt a new standard is technically violating CE mark requirements and could be prosecuted by EU authorities. \r\n More Information is Available: \r\n If you need more information on getting the CE marking for the EMC Directive, call the U.S. Department of Commerce EU specialists: Bob Straetz at 202-482-4496 in the Office of EU Affairs or Sylvia Mohr at 011 32 2 508 2675 at the U.S. Mission to the EU in Brussels, Belgium. \r\n Consult the U.S. Commercial Service website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.buyusa.gov/europeanunion. --\u0026gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/europeanunion \r\n Duquesne University Center for the International Regulatory Assistance, partially funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Market Development Cooperator Program of the U.S. Department of Commerce, has information on the CE marking at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.citra.duq.edu. --\u0026gt;http://www.citra.duq.edu \r\n \u0026lt;!--SS_END_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- Code Added to have buyusa home pages move to export.gov --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- New Code Ended --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt; ","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"CE Marking Process for the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"289","content":"   \r\n White House Releases Report to the President on the National Export Initiative \r\n The White House released a report to the President on the National Export Initiative (NEI).

This document also provides information on where standards can be purchased, and presents a list of labs around the country that can do CE marking testing for the Safety of Machinery Directive. \r\n PHASE 1: Does the Safety of Machinery Directive Apply to Your Product? \r\n As a manufacturer, you need to secure copies of the directives and judge whether they apply to your product. The European Commission does not publish a list of products to which their laws apply. They require the manufacturer to determine the applicability of directives to any given product. The Safety of Machinery Directive (98/37/EC) is very broad in scope, covering any equipment that has moving parts (excluding manually operated equipment). \r\n In some cases, a product might be covered by more than one directive. For example, a machine would probably be covered by the Machinery, EMC, and Low Voltage Directives. A manufacturer must meet the CE marking requirements for all the directives that apply to the company’s product. To view the machinery directive, go to the European Commission’s website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org. --\u0026gt;http://www.newapproach.org and click on “Directives and Standards.” Then click on the Safety of Machinery Directive. \r\n The purpose of the Machinery Directive is to integrate safety into the design, production, adjustment, maintenance, assembly and dismantling of machines, and thereby reduce, as far as possible, the chance of accidents and harm to persons at risk. Article I defines machinery as “an assembly of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves, with the appropriate actuators, control and power circuits, etc., joined together for a specific application, in particular for the processing, treatment, moving or packaging of a material.” Also covered by the machinery directive are assemblies of machines that function as an integral whole, interchangeable equipment modifying the function of a machine, and “safety components.” A safety component fulfills a safety function when in use, and would endanger the safety or health of exposed persons if it failed or malfunctioned. \r\n The Machinery Directive is very broad in scope, covering any equipment which has moving parts (excluding manually operated equipment) joined together for a specific application, in particular for the processing, treatment, moving or packaging of a material. Safety components (such as emergency stopping devices or safety belts and restraining devices in the event of overturning) that protect workers from hazards are also covered by the Machinery Directive. The Machinery Directive also covers mobile machines, machines intended for use underground, and machine lifts. \r\n Article I, paragraph 3 lists products that are excluded from coverage by the Machinery Directive. Some examples from the list of 18 entries are: Machinery powered manually (unless used for lifting or lowering loads); special equipment for use in fairgrounds and/or amusement parks; steam boilers, tanks and pressure vessels; firearms; radioactive sources forming part of a machine; and seagoing vessels and mobile offshore units together with equipment on board such vessels or units. \r\n The products listed in Article I, paragraph 3 are usually covered by another CE marking directive or possibly by member state regulations. \r\n For more information on the CE marking and the EU Machinery Directive, see the booklets published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) entitled, “NIST GCR 814 – A Guide to the EU Machinery Directive,” and “NIST SP 951 – A Guide to EU Standards and Conformity Assessment,” which are available on the website \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ts.nist.gov/europe. --\u0026gt;http://ts.nist.gov/europe. \r\n PHASE 2: Check to see if Your Product is Listed in Annex IV of the Safety of Machinery Directive \r\n Machines listed in Annex IV cannot be self-certified because the European Union has decided these machines are too dangerous. There are 17 machines listed in Annex IV (mostly saws, presses, injection or compression molding machines, lifts, and machinery for work underground) along with five safety components. \r\n A manufacturer has two options to certify machinery listed in Annex IV of the directive: (1) Submit an example of the machine to an EU-affiliate lab for an EC type-examination (in which the manufacturer submits a representative model or “type” to see if that machine satisfies the provisions of the directive that apply to it); or, (2) conform to the European standards applicable to the firm's product, compile a technical file, and submit the report to an EU notified body for review and approval. \r\n Option (1): If a manufacturer chooses to get an EC type-examination, the lab it uses must be affiliated with a notified body because notified bodies are the only entities authorized to issue a certificate for the CE marking. Annex VI of the Machinery Directive has detailed information about what is entailed in a type-examination of a machine. For a list of labs that can do testing and certification for the Machinery Directive, see the link \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- ./main/cemark/eg_main_017274. --\u0026gt;Testing/Certifying Labs on the sidebar on this page and throughout this website. This list is not an endorsement for any laboratory. There are other labs, not listed on our link, that can do testing for this Directive. \r\n Option (2): If a manufacturer chooses to conform to the European standards, consult the list of standards for the “Safety of Machinery” Directive at the European Commission’s website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org. --\u0026gt;http://www.newapproach.org and click on “Directives and Standards” to see which standards apply to the machine and then order the appropriate standards. Some sources for ordering standards are listed on the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- ./main/cemark/eg_main_017270. --\u0026gt;Consultants/Ordering Standards link on the sidebar of this page and throughout this website. Once a manufacturer obtains the standards, it needs to conform to the standards, draw up a technical file (see PHASE 7) providing evidence that the manufacturer has met the European standards, and then send the technical file to a notified body for verification that the standards were correctly applied. The notified body will draw up a certificate of adequacy for the file. The risk involved in option 2 is that the notified body might reject the technical file, which would cause the manufacturer to lose time and money. The advantage of option 2 over option 1 is that it is usually less costly than option 1 because there is no expense for the lab test. \r\n The booklet written by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) entitled, “A Guide to the EU Machinery Directive” at the website \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ts.nist.gov/europe. --\u0026gt;http://ts.nist.gov/europe has an excellent section on Annex IV of the machinery directive. \r\n PHASE 3: Overview of CE Marking Requirements for the Safety of Machinery Directive \r\n For most machinery, manufacturers can self-certify compliance with the directive by meeting the “essential health and safety requirements” outlined in Annex I of the Directive. However, machinery listed in Annex IV of the Directive, primarily saws, presses, and safety components, have been deemed exceptionally hazardous and must be tested and approved by a lab affiliated with a European Union notified body (See PHASE 2). \r\n For more information on CE marking and the EU Machinery Directive, see the booklets published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) entitled, “NIST GCR 814 – A Guide to the EU Machinery Directive,” and “NIST SP 951 – A Guide to EU Standards and Conformity Assessment,” which are available on the website \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ts.nist.gov/europe. --\u0026gt;http://ts.nist.gov/europe. \r\n Annex I of the Machinery Directive contains the descriptions of the “essential health and safety requirements (EHSRs) relating to the design and construction of machinery and safety components.” There are about 100 EHSRs listed. The first part of Annex I applies to general machinery. Examples of EHSRs described for general machinery are: lighting, materials and products, design of machinery to facilitate its handling, control devices, starting, stopping, emergency stop, mode selection, stability, software, failure of power supply, special requirements for guards, etc. The EHSRs are fairly detailed and give manufacturers guidance on what actions must be taken to satisfy the requirements. The purpose of the EHSRs is to eliminate or reduce dangers caused by operating the machine. A manufacturer can self-certify compliance with the Machinery Directive by meeting the EHSRs that apply to its product and recording the solutions to these problems in a technical file (see PHASE 6). As long as the manufacturer’s machine is not listed in Annex IV of the Directive, the company can use any group of standards it wants–European, international, or U.S.–to meet these applicable EHSRs. For machines listed in Annex IV, please refer to PHASE 2. \r\n Besides general machinery, there are several separate categories of machinery covered in Annex I. These categories include: Certain categories of machinery (agri-foodstuffs machinery, portable hand-held and/or hand-guided machinery, and machinery for working wood and analogous materials); mobile machinery; lifts for people; and machinery for work underground. Lifts for people, machinery for work underground, and some machines for woodworking are listed in Annex IV and need to be type-certified by a notified body. The other types of machines listed in this paragraph can be self-certified by meeting the applicable EHSRs of the directive and recording these solutions in a technical file. \r\n Although a manufacturer whose machine does not appear in Annex IV of the machinery directive can self-certify and does not need to use a lab, the manufacturer can still employ a lab if the manufacturer has questions on how to meet a particular EHSR or if the company wants help setting up a quality control system to ensure that machines being produced subsequently will meet CE marking requirements. A lab performing testing on a machine that is not listed in Annex IV of the machine directive does not have to be affiliated with a European notified body. \r\n Note: Operating instructions are covered in Annex I, article 1.7.3. The article states that operating instructions must be in the language of the user when the machine is put into service. The translation can be done either by the manufacturer, his authorized representative, or by the person introducing the machinery into the language area in question. \r\n PHASE 4: Identify the European Standards for the Machinery Directive That Apply to Your Product \r\n Refer to the European Commission's website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org. --\u0026gt;http://www.newapproach.org to get a complete listing of European standards for the Machinery Directive. The \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- ./main/cemark/eg_main_017270. --\u0026gt;Consultants/Ordering Standards link on the sidebar of this page and throughout the Trade Information Center's CE marking website lists some sources for ordering standards. The European Union has developed about 500 standards for this directive. A large group of standards covers specific types of machinery (such as earthmoving machinery, rubber and plastics machinery, packaging machinery, agricultural and forestry machinery, pumps, and many more). Another group of standards sets rules for characteristics of machines such as acoustics, ergonomics and noise emissions, and another small group of standards covers the general principles of machine safety. \r\n The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) develops the standards for the machinery directive. Use of European standards is not required for a U.S. company to self-certify to the essential requirements of the machine directive. A company can use U.S., international, or European standards to meet the essential requirements of the directive. \r\n European standards do have to be used to meet CE marking requirements for machines listed in Annex IV. The machines in Annex IV cannot be self-certified because the European Union has deemed them too dangerous. There are 17 machines listed in Annex IV (mostly saws, presses, injection or compression molding machines, lifts, and machinery for work underground) along with five safety components. \r\n PHASE 5: Meet the Appropriate Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) and Establish a Quality Control System \r\n The manufacturer's engineering and technical staff should determine which essential health and safety requirements (EHSRs) apply to its machine, and then go about meeting the requirements. Use of European, U.S., or international standards is acceptable for meeting the requirements. The manufacturer does not need to get a lab test to show EHSRs were met, though a lab could be employed if the manufacturer wanted. The manufacturer will have to establish some sort of quality control system to ensure that future products also meet the CE marking requirements. ISO 9000 is not a legally required quality control system, though it does have high market visibility and could be advantageous from a marketing point of view. \r\n PHASE 6: Assemble a Technical File \r\n The main purpose of having manufacturers compile a technical file is for European Community authorities to conduct market surveillance activities efficiently. Annex V, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Machinery Directive outlines the information to be supplied in a technical file. To summarize briefly, the technical file for the machinery directive contains the operating instructions (in the language of the country where the machine is going to be used) and then, for series manufacturers, the quality control program that will be implemented to ensure that the machinery remains in conformity with the directive. A description of information manufacturers must provide for instructions is found in Annex I of the directive, under 1.7.4.–“Instructions.” For more information on how to put together a technical file, please consult the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- ./main/cemark/eg_main_017275. --\u0026gt;Technical File Procedures link on the sidebar of this page and throughout the Trade Information Center's CE marking website for more information. \r\n U.S. manufacturers whose machines are not listed in Annex IV can include in their technical file any standard (U.S., international, or European) and accompanying diagrams and solutions as long as the company meets the relevant EHSRs of the directive. The company can also use test results performed in the U.S. in its technical file to show compliance to the EHSRs of the directive. \r\n PHASE 7: Affix the CE Marking to Your Product \r\n Annex III of the Machinery Directive (at www.newapproach.org) discusses the rules of applying CE marking. The manufacturer must have met the relevant essential health and safety requirements (EHSRs) and have compiled a technical file proving conformity before applying the CE marking. The CE marking must be visible, must be affixed so it will not come off, and must be at least 5 mm in height. See the European Commission's, \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/documents/blue-guide/. --\u0026gt;\"Guide to the Implementation of Directives Based on New Approach and Global Approach\" to see a picture of the CE marking and a brief description of it. At the website, click on 7, CE Marking, and go to page 45 to see the picture. If your product is covered by more than one CE marking directive (such as by the Machine, EMC, and Low Voltage Directives), then it is assumed that the CE marking will not be put on the product until CE marking requirements have been met for all the directives covering the manufacturer’s product. \r\n PHASE 8: Create the Declaration of Conformity \r\n Annex II of the Machinery Directive describes the items a manufacturer must include in the declaration of conformity. The declaration of conformity accompanies each shipment of machinery to Europe. The EC declaration of conformity is the document on which the manufacturer, or his authorized representative established in the Community, declares that the machinery being placed on the market complies with all the “essential health and safety requirements” applying to it. The signature of a company officer is required to indicate that the manufacturer has taken responsibility for having met CE marking requirements for the Machinery Directive. Paragraph A in Annex II describes the content for the declaration of conformity for machinery. Paragraph B outlines the content of the declaration of “incorporation,” which applies to a part of a machine that is going to be incorporated into a larger unit. Finally, paragraph C addresses the contents of a declaration of conformity for safety components. The contents for all three are roughly the same. Although there is no set format for drawing up a declaration of conformity, the Commerce Department has put together a sample declaration of conformity for companies to look at and possibly model their own after. To access this sample, see the \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- ./main/cemark/eg_main_017272. --\u0026gt;Declaration of Conformity link on the sidebar of this page and throughout the Trade Information Center's CE marking website. \r\n PHASE 9: Keep Posted on Updates of Standards Which Might Affect Your Product \r\n The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has been very active in issuing new and updated standards for the Machinery Directive. U.S. manufacturers can keep updated on EU standards by consulting the European Commission’s website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org. --\u0026gt;http://www.newapproach.org. The use of European standards is voluntary, but use of European standards does give a presumption of conformity for the directive and is especially important for getting a type-examination certificate for a machine listed in Annex IV of the directive. \r\n More Information is Available: \r\n If you need more information on getting the CE mark for the Safety of Machinery Directive, call either of the Department of Commerce EU specialists: Bob Straetz at 202-482-4496 in the Office of EU Affairs, or Sylvia Mohr at 011 32 2 508 2675. \r\n Consult the U.S. Commercial Service website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.buyusa.gov/europeanunion. --\u0026gt;http://www.buyusa.gov/europeanunion \r\n Duquesne University Center for International Regulatory Assistance, partially funded by the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Market Development Cooperator Program of the U.S. Department of Commerce, has information on the CE mark at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.duq.edu/about/centers-and-institutes/international-regulatory-assistance. --\u0026gt;http://www.duq.edu/about/centers-and-institutes/international-regulatory-assistance \r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_END_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt;\r\n   \r\n\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- Code Added to have buyusa home pages move to export.gov --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- New Code Ended --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"Safety of Machinery","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":[]},{"id":"302","content":" PHASE 1: Does the Medical Devices: In Vitro Diagnostic Directive Apply to Your Product? \r\n The overview of the Medical Devices: In Vitro Diagnostic Directive is currently being developed.

The European Commission does not publish a list of products to which their laws apply; they require the manufacturer to determine the applicability of directives to any given product. The purpose of the Equipment and Protective Systems in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres directive is protect the safety and health of persons, domestic animals and property against the hazards resulting from the use of equipment and systems providing protection against potentially explosive atmospheres. \r\n Chapter I, Article 1 describes the equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. Included are safety devices, controlling devices and regulating devices intended for use outside potentially explosive atmospheres but required for or contributing to the safe functioning of equipment and protective systems with respect to the risks of explosion. The article defines ‘equipment’, ‘protective systems’ and ‘components’ within the context of the directive. Equipment Group I applies to equipment intended for use in underground parts of mines, and to those parts of surface installations of such mines, liable to be endangered by firedamp and/or combustible dust. Equipment Group II applies to equipment intended for use in other places liable to be endangered by explosive atmospheres.

Annex I lists criteria for the classification of equipment groups into categories. The directive sets out essential requirements only. Harmonized standards are necessary, especially with regard to the non-electrical aspects of protection against explosions. These standards relate to the design, manufacture and testing of equipment, compliance with which enables a product to be presumed to meet the essential requirements of the directive. \r\n Manufacturers of equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres are not permitted to self-certify the compliance of their products. The U.S. manufacturer must hire a test lab affiliated with a notified body; test results are subsequently sent to the notified body for evaluation and approval, following which the notified body issues a certificate. (Notified bodies are companies which have been selected by the EU member states and “notified” to the European Commission as being competent to test and certify products under a particular directive where third party testing is required. Notified bodies must be located in the EU and are the only entities allowed to give final product approval under directives requiring CE marking, although their affiliates outside the EU are allowed to test products and send results to the parent for approval.) \r\n To view the Equipment and Protective Systems in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres directive, and to see the latest list of standards for that directive, please go the European Commission's website at \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.newapproach.org/. --\u0026gt;http:// www.newapproach.org and click on \"Directives and Standards.\" \r\n This overview of the Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres is still being developed.

Seminar participants will engage senior government representatives and other experts on key issues related to the U.S. economy and the global marketplace. \r\n WHY: \r\n The Western Hemisphere is an ideal export market for potential entrepreneurs, as well as existing U.S. companies. For example, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), in part due to geographic proximity, has given U.S. products a substantial competitive edge over goods from other countries. \r\n Technological advances, coupled with increasing consumer demands abroad, have created unparalleled opportunities for U.S. companies seeking to introduce their products and services to the international marketplace. The commercial success of several free trade agreements in the Western Hemisphere (NAFTA, U.S.- Chile, CAFTA-DR) make the region a strategic and profitable business prospect for U.S. companies. There is also an increasing need for a well-trained, globally-focused workforce capable of supporting American business interests abroad. \r\n The purpose of this event is to increase the knowledge of business owners concerning the export opportunities in the Region and increase their understanding of the overall benefits of free trade. Presenters will also discuss the broad range of career opportunities in the fields of international affairs and trade policy. \r\n WHO: \r\n Are you an aspiring entrepreneur with a unique idea, but in need of additional resources or tools to conduct crucial research that will enable you to successfully introduce your product or service to a foreign market? Are you an existing small, medium-sized, or minority-owned U.S. company looking to expand your customer base? Are you a faculty member or student of an academic institution who desires a greater understanding of the global job market, and how U.S. exports support the U.S. economy? Are you interested in a career in the field of international business? Then you would benefit from attending this event. \r\n WHEN: \r\n These seminars are taking place on the campuses of minority serving institutions across the United States. The program includes keynote speakers, panel discussions, and valuable networking opportunities with representatives from government, industry, academia, and regional international trade associations. The strategic alliance between minority serving institutions and the local minority business community was a key factor in developing the model for this unique seminar series.   \r\n \u0026lt;!--SS_END_OPENREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--SS_END_CLOSEREGIONMARKER(region1)--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- Code Added to have buyusa home pages move to export.gov --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- New Code Ended --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment11,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment16,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment15,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment18,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment19,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_BEGIN_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!--SS_END_SNIPPET(fragment17,Presentation)--\u0026gt; ","pub_date":"2013-03-08","title":"About the Series","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":true,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":[],"keyword":["MES","Minority"]},{"id":"282","content":" July 19, 2011 \r\n Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade Francisco Sánchez and American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) President and Chief Executive Officer Kurt Nagle today announced a new partnership to support President Obama’s goal of doubling exports by 2014.  \r\n \u0026lt;!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!-- .http://www.trade.gov/press/press-releases/2011/international-trade-administration-us-seaports-agree-to-new-partnership-to-increase-exports-071911.asp. --\u0026gt;View the ITA Press Release in its entirety.

Examples include high tariffs, investment restrictions such as local content requirements, weak enforcement of intellectual property rights, non-transparent regulations and licensing regimes, and burdensome certification requirements not required of domestic manufacturers, non-uniform application of customs procedures, lack of competitive bidding for foreign government tenders, provision of direct or indirect subsidies by a foreign government in favor of its domestic suppliers \r\n \r\n  Restrictions on the range of services offered by foreign services providers \r\n Influence peddling – interference of a corporate entity or country with fair trade practices at another company’s expense \r\n Bribery, corruption and requests for payoffs – when foreign bribery prevents you from competing fairly on the basis of price, quality, or service \r\n  \r\n Report a trade barrier to the U.S Department of Commerce’s Office of Energy and Environmental Industries by filling out the online questionnaire. (Trade barrier inquiries remain private). \r\n U.S. Government Advocacy for International Tenders \r\n The Advocacy Center at the U.S. Department of Commerce helps to ensure that U.S. products and services have the best possible chance competing for foreign government tenders.  Advocacy Center assistance entails the coordination of senior U.S. Government communication with foreign governments or government-owned corporations on behalf of U.S. businesses in a competitive bid contest.  \r\n Examples of advocacy assistance include: \r\n \r\n  Assistance from U.S. embassies and consulates endorsing U.S. bidders \r\n Delivery of promotional messages through a variety of media (for example, letters, phone calls, or face-to-face meetings) by senior U.S. government officials \r\n Coordination of other U.S. government agencies (such as the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation) for financial support \r\n  \r\n The Advocacy Center also has liaisons to five multilateral development banks (World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Africa Development Bank and Asia Development Bank) to assist U.S. firms and to advocate on their behalf when they compete for tenders from these banks. The liaisons counsel U.S. companies on how to work with the banks and advocate on procurement and contracting issues to ensure fair and equal treatment for U.S. companies. \r\n Eligibility: \r\n The U.S. national interest is the overall basis for determining the nature and extent of U.S. government support for a viable bid or proposal in connection with an international transaction. Please see the Advocacy Guidelines for more details. \r\n Get Started \r\n Get started with your advocacy request by filing an Advocacy Questionnaire and Anti-Bribery Agreement with the Advocacy Center. Along with the questionnaire, the company must complete the Anti-Bribery Agreement, certifying that neither the company nor its affiliates will engage in bribery of foreign officials. Learn more about the Advocacy application process here. \r\n Develop New Markets \r\n The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) supports project development in partner countries through the funding of technical assistance provided by U.S. companies and firms. These activities are diverse and reflect the coupling of U.S. industry capabilities and products and USTDA’s overseas project partners needs and goals. \r\n By supporting such activities as: \r\n \r\n  legal and regulatory reforms related to commercial activities and infrastructure development, \r\n Feasibility studies and demonstration projects, and \r\n establishment of industry standards. \r\n  \r\n USTDA is facilitating the creation of favorable business and trade environments for U.S.-based goods and services worldwide. \r\n Reach out to USTDA regional staff directly to learn more about programs in markets of interest. \r\n Opportunities to conduct USTDA-funded technical assistance and feasibility studies are usually advertised on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Links to relevant FBO announcements are posted on USTDA's website. USTDA-funded and U.S.-led feasibility studies link foreign project sponsors with U.S. businesses at the critical early stage when technology options and project requirements are being defined. These studies evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, legal and other critical aspects of infrastructure development projects that are of interest to potential lenders and investors. This specialized form of assistance is designed to provide the detailed professional analysis that major infrastructure investments need to move forward to financing and implementation, thereby opening new export opportunities for U.S. companies. \r\n Tap into Free U.S. Commercial Service Market Research \r\n Access the U.S. Commercial Service’s Market Research Library which contains more than 100,000 market reports, authored by the International Trade Administration’s industry and country specialists including those working in overseas posts. Hundreds of reports from recent years related to Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RE\u0026amp;EE) can be found through a keyword search of the library. U.S. companies and students or researchers can register with Export.gov to have full access. \r\n Tune into ITA’s webinars to hear from U.S. Commercial Service and industry trade experts about how your company can increase its international sales.

But now I'd like to introduce live online Commercial Counselor, Margaret Hanson-Muse of the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, Columbia. Maggie, thank you very much for joining us. \r\n Margaret Hanson-Muse: Thank you very much Linda. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with the audience that you have gathered for me today. I'm Maggie Hanson-Muse. I've been here in Columbia for three years and witnessed the incredible growth and transformation during the (rebay) administration that has really afforded new opportunities for U.S. exporters. \r\n In particular, we have I think very exciting opportunities thanks to the support of the U.S. Ex-Im Bank in the oil and gas industry. Let me tell you a quick story about how it all began. Probably ten years ago the U.S. Trade Development Agency targeted the hydrocarbons industry here in Columbia as one of their top priorities. \r\n After years of providing grants and studies, it resulted in two major awards, the first being to Chicago Bridge \u0026amp; Iron a $3.8 billion award to modernize the refinery in Cartagena; and the second being to Foster Wheeler to probably a $3.6 billion award to modernize the Barrancabermeja refinery here in Columbia. \r\n Well, that sounds great. And engineering services company has won these contracts. What does it mean for you the U.S. Exporter? It means a huge opportunity to provide anything ranging from nuts and bolts to pipes to sophisticated electronic sensors, pumps, valves and compressors in order to be able to - to be able to take part in these exciting changes here in Columbia. \r\n So I'm going to for those of you who have not been to Columbia before, take a very quick walk through. We know we kept you waiting. So I want to make this as quick as possible so that everybody has the chance to speak and you have a chance to ask your questions. \r\n So we'll walk through what it’s like to do business in Columbia and we'll spend a little time talking about the needs that Ecopetrol is going to have in the future. And (Ziamara), my colleague from Ex-Im Bank will tell you about the $1 billion commitment that Ex-Im made January 20 of this year to try and make it more attractive for you U.S. exporters to send your products to Columbia. \r\n You’re looking at our first slide, which has three different scenarios form Columbia, and I think this helps sum up what it’s like here. It’s diversity. Columbia has a diverse climate, vegetation, (fara) - (farnet) rather and people. \r\n I'm trying to go to the next slide. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: I got it Maggie. \r\n Margaret Hanson-Muse: Okay. Thank you. For Columbia it has about 45 million people. It’s three times the size of Montana or twice the size of France. I'm a scuba diver so it excites me that in Columbia I'm able to go diving in places like San Andreas, Providencia and Santa Catalina Archipelago. \r\n For those of you who've never been here, Delta, Continental and American Airlines runs frequent non-stop services from four gateway cities, Atlanta, Miami, Houston and Newark to Bogota, Medellin, Cali and Cartagena and Barranquilla. \r\n Also during the time I've been here, Spirit Airways and Jet Blue have been granted routes if you want to take a lower cost no frills airline to get to Columbia. \r\n Avianca, the national carrier, now has a direct flight from Washington, D.C. in a codeshare with Delta. And Spirit Airways will be initiating service to what’s called the coffer triangle from its Ft. Lauderdale hub. \r\n The country as you can see has access to two oceans. And we really advise that you take a few Spanish classes before you travel because Spanish is the official language. Also think about printing your sales materials and ads in Spanish. Next slide please. \r\n I put the BlackBerry in this slide because I want you guys to understand that Columbia is a modern society where your BlackBerrys will work. The country is experiencing an infrastructure boom. We have now opened the New J.W. Marriott here. There are now two Marriott hotels in Bogota alone. And Marriott has the intention of building seven more hotels in the next five years. Hyatt and Hilton are not far behind. \r\n In terms of road infrastructure, we’re seeing basically the equivalent of the interstate system of the United States that was built during the Eisenhower administration being built and deployed here in Columbia in the next five years. We have also huge mass transportation projects in major cities under construction. \r\n The country is also stepping up its efforts to produce oil and natural gas as well as minerals like coal, gold and emeralds. If you look at how the elections have been, this is the most stable democracy in the hemisphere after the United States, a very long tradition of elections. We recently had our election of the new President who will take office August the 7th along with his new team. \r\n You've also seen that the peso is appreciated against the dollar without hyperinflation. What that means is because we don't have a free trade agreement, your products will be less expensive to your European and other competitors. \r\n We can't beat out Chinese competition because they sell things very cheaply here. But at least people, if you sell on of quality basis, you'll have a bit of - an advantage over other suppliers. Next slide please. \r\n One thing to keep in mind is Columbia has never defaulted on its debt payments. Many people worry about what they call shaky Latin American Government that this point they are not investment grade. We expect that to happen within the next 24 months. \r\n They’re the strong - they’re the 5th largest market for U.S. products in Latin America. When I came here in 2007, they were 29th in terms of U.S. export. Now they’re 26th in terms of received U.S. exports in the world. \r\n Good news for manufacturers; they use U.S. standards in water, electricity and obviously oil and gas engineering equipment. And they really do prefer U.S. products. We have lots of U.S. franchises here from McDonald's, Burger King, KFC. Everybody watched the World Cup via cable TV or Direct TV. You have DSL access via cable into your home. You do have some public wireless Internet but it’s usually limited to hotel lobbies. Next please. \r\n With the exception of one year, the economy has grown steadily for the last 72 years. The global economic crisis had an impact on them but they didn't go negative like we did in the United States. \r\n The other key fact to keep in mind, and this is another reason why we’re seeing such tremendous growth in the oil and gas industry, is what we call the Venezuela affect. The Venezuelans closed their border to trade the 4th quarter of last year and that has really negatively impacted Columbia’s GDP. \r\n And about a week - this weekend or last Friday, Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Columbia. We believe that things will be changing with the new administration. However, it does mean that even more emphasis is going to be placed on the Columbian oil and gas industry as it becomes even more difficult to do business with Columbia. Next slide please. \r\n You'll see the tremendous growth here of Columbia. It’s an economic miracle having nearly tripled its exports and imports from 2000 up to 2009. We expect the 2010 growth rate to recover to a more reasonable percentage of 3 to 4% in terms of GDP growth. Next please. \r\n Just so that people understand, I always like to put up this slide with just a reference to Pablo Escobar. Many people still don't realize he died in 1993 and really the U.S. Government working with the Columbian Government has made tremendous progress in terms of improving the security here in Columbia. \r\n That’s one of the reasons why we’re seeing more and more multinational companies switch their headquarters from Caracas to Bogota. It’s a safer place to do business. You have more formal business practices and you have much, much improved security. The picture on the right is a picture of downtown Bogota at night. Next please. \r\n I can't not make a presentation without dealing with the C word; in this case corruption. I can't say that it’s been totally eliminated from Columbia but compared to what it was like in 1990s, there’s a lot more transparency. People understand that bribery just doesn't work and once you start paying a bribe, you'll never be able to stop. \r\n And with more and more companies like Ecopetrol listing themselves on the New York Stock Exchange, you have more supervision by the Department of Justice and the SEC. So you really do see that people are trying to clean up their act. \r\n You’re seeing also that Columbia has gone from just being Juan Valdez, I export coffee, to diversifying it’s exports and to signing more free trade agreements. Their economy is becoming more and more open each day. They still have a ways to go and the U.S. Government through USAID works on these kinds of issues especially to open opportunities for small to medium sized companies. Next please. \r\n These are you challenges. There are still at least four big social challenges and five big economic challenges. But the key strategy for U.S. export is to keep in mind is to offer trade financing to address the last issue. Many of your partners here may lack access to credit financing and therefore if you’re able to come in with your X in bank financing lined up, you will find a big open market. \r\n You also need - if you've never done business here before, you also need to be aware that probably 60% of the economy of the businesses are informal and you'll run into a lot of red tape. But if you’re working with the commercial service, Delilah - my colleagues Delilah and Nya and our offices here, you will be able to overcome that red tape and join the thousands of U.S. companies that have been successful doing business here. Next please. \r\n You'll see that we expect Columbia to grow 3 to 4%. Again, I already mentioned the Venezuelan border. That does - that will still continue to have an impact on trade. We’re - my biggest concern representing U.S. business interests here is the growing influence of China, India and Brazil. \r\n And I know in the oil and gas industry especially since the disaster in the gulf, there will be more emphasis on high quality equipment, which is where I believe U.S. companies have a definite advantage and guarantees. This is something that China and India in their haste to sell things quickly, they sometimes skip on quality. So that is something to really hammer as you market your products here. \r\n Columbia’s doing a lot more trading and investment with Peru. They've accepted UL standard. They are the largest Facebook user in Latin America. So if you think that there’s a way to market your product using social marketing, go right ahead because you'll find that there are communities on Facebook and LinkedIn. \r\n And I already mentioned that the Ex-Im Bank granted a billion dollars to Ecopetrol to use to purchase U.S. products. Next please. \r\n Just a quick run through of the FTA negotiations. Ours is still pending ratification in the U.S. Congress but Canada and the European Union have approved their FTA. And the question is when will they implement. Some say as soon as January 2011 for Canada, which will make life very difficult for us here especially if you’re a wheat farmer. \r\n But we will see because we know that in Columbia law there’s still many hurdles and reforms that they have to undertake and implement before they will be able to respect the obligations they've signed up for. So we’re hopeful that the U.S. free trade agreement will be ratified by the U.S. Congress in the coming months. Next please. \r\n Just in case you hadn't heard, since they’re - a lot of them are from Texas. Our three hostages were released two years ago. We actually had a huge 4th of July party to celebrate that on the 2nd of July this year. But in general, just - people always ask me what are the stats. Here are the stats. \r\n Security just is not the issue that it used to be. And - but we do warn - we do advise people to use just common sense when you’re going into remote areas. Check with the Embassy. Check with the company that you’re working with to make sure you’re taking the right measures. Next please. \r\n Now we just get into what the best prospects are for Columbia. We’re talking about oil and gas. So Linda, we can just go through these next slides fairly quickly. Next please. \r\n We'll now start to talk about oil and gas. So I'm going to turn it over to Julio briefly to describe what’s going on in the oil and gas industry. \r\n Julio Carbo: Thanks you Margaret. Well, Columbia is the 3rd largest exporter of crude oil in South America from Brazil and Venezuela. And the growth of the market is continuing at an even faster rate. \r\n Columbia has reserves of 1.9 billion barrels and a production level of 671,000 barrels per day. But as of June 2010, the production rate increased to 757,000 barrels per day of which Ecopetrol, the largest Columbia oil company, the national oil company, is producing 550,000 barrels per day. \r\n The ratio between research and production yields eight more years of production levels and consumption internally for fuels. So the country has embarked on a large exploration campaign in order to identify new reserves. \r\n Natural gas reserves in 2009 reached 8.6 (tera) cubic feet of gas on the production level. And as of June of 1116 million cubic feet per day. And the reserve to production ratio is 22.8 years. \r\n The (unintelligible) prospecting activity has reach 112 kilometers of (seismic 2D) equivalent. And (83) wells drilled since 2002 reached 443. This is a record number. \r\n In addition, the contracting activities by the National Hydrocarbons Agency, that is the agency that administer the hydrocarbon research, has reached 346 contracts of which 266 are actual exploration and production contracts and the remainder at the so-called technical evolution assessment. Basically is developing additional studies, pre-processing seismic before actually committing to any drilling activity. \r\n Right now the assigned area for exploration reach 21 million hectares of which 14 million is onshore and the remainder offshore both on the Caribbean and Pacific Ocean. The production areas are two million hectares. \r\n Recently in June the National Hydrocarbons Agency awarded 80 blocks on their so-called Ronda Columbia is an option of 47 million hectares of 228 blocks in areas that had onshore in the Caribbean all the way to San Andreas Highland North of Panama and the Pacific Ocean, the whole (unintelligible) on a smaller mini blocks for smaller companies. \r\n Margaret Hanson-Muse: Don't change the slide Linda. Just hold there please. \r\n Julio Carbo: Ecopetrol changed the global and competitive industry as when President (Weben) enacted Decree 1716, 2003 that authorized the government to auction off 10% of the company and created the what is so-called (mace) economy but majorities are still owned by the government. \r\n (Unintelligible) company like in America... \r\n Margaret Hanson-Muse: Fourth largest. \r\n Julio Carbo: ...the fourth largest and 17% production growth in 2009. It controls over 10,000 kilometers of transportation infrastructure and has an existing 330,000 barrels per day of refining capacity. \r\n Ecopetrol has procurement needs of today near 2020 and they expect (unintelligible) of up to $80 billion and aims to produce one million barrels per day in 2015 and up 1.3 million barrels per day by 2020. \r\n The projected investment for 2010 is 6.9 billion of which 68% goes to exploration, 4.5 billion and production investments on exploration of $951 million. \r\n The current investment for this year for the refinery capacity is $1.3 billion. And the (product) aims to reach the refining capacity of 415,000 per day in 2013 in to projects; one in Cartagena; one in Barrancabermeja. \r\n In addition, the company is streamlining their procurement process. It is not necessary for U.S. companies to register at this point of time. Basically if you search the Web site www.ecopetrol.com and look for (Provedores), the basically suppliers and look for the contracting alternatives, you will find a links for market intelligence, selection processes and previous contracting activities and so on. \r\n I will provide you the information of these links at a later date. We have key contacts in Ecopetrol that specializes on a different area. \r\n Margaret Hanson-Muse: All right. We'll return to the presentation please Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay. Stay on this slide? \r\n Margaret Hanson-Muse: Okay. Okay. We have to - okay. Julio talked about the refinery project and we've listed what we think the equipment needs are going to be. Also keep in mind that Ecopetrol if you look at its logo, it’s an iguana and that stands for clean energy. \r\n They’re looking to lean up diesel, get rid of (unintelligible) and do anything that makes sense in terms of providing more energy to people at a lower cost and on a clean basis. \r\n So these are just some of the things that we came up with and Nya and Delilah have a study that Julio wrote that will enable you to go into more detail. All of the statistics that he read to you will be available as a handout. It'll be uploaded shortly. Okay. Next slide please. \r\n This just talks about what Ex-Im is doing with Ecopetrol here. In Columbia Ex-Im is also interested in working on the Bogota airport renovation. And I'm not going to say anything more because this is really (Ziamara)’s area. Next please. You can keep going. These are just the other best prospects. Next please. Next please. \r\n We talked a bit about the refinery modernization but since a lot of people in oil and gas have some sort of tangential relationship with ports and other infrastructure projects, we want you to know that there’s three ports that are undergoing a big renovation. We already told you a little bit about the super highway that’s being built. \r\n Columbia’s planning to launch a satellite. And besides the Bogota, there’s another package of airports that are going to be privatized and concessions in the next year. Next please. This just tells you the trade shows that we’re doing in 2010 that don't really relate to you. Next please. \r\n In 2011 we'll be coming back again to the offshore technology conference. I don't know those of you who were there. But Columbia had a lunch for 350 people. It was the largest one in the history of the conference. And therefore there’s a lot of excitement about our little country. Next please. \r\n Just so that you know, we do run trade missions to Columbia. The one we’re targeting to invite you to is the one that we’re running in conjunction with the certified trade show November 2 through 5 of this year. You'll come to Bogota for a day and then go to Cartagena for four days. Delilah and Nya will tell you more about that. Next please. \r\n Now if you've never done business in Columbia, these are things that you absolutely must do. If you have - would like to work with us to find your local partner, work through Nya and Delilah and they'll hook you up. \r\n If you’re already found a local partner, talk to us directly so that we can do a background check in order to make sure they’re not a bad person because you can't use the excuse I didn't know with the Department of Justice. They want to make sure that you’re not doing business with a known narco trafficker or a known terrorist. \r\n Frankly this applies to Israel. It applies to Saudi Arabia. It applies to countries in Africa. It applies to China. It applies to Hong Kong. Wherever you go, you absolutely must do a thorough background check before you sign a contract for somebody to represent your company. It’s very, very important. \r\n Also I caution you to include arbitration clauses in your contract with distributors in case you need a less expensive ways in the court system to get out of a problem. \r\n And in terms of security, you just use situational awareness. It’s like being in Los Angeles, Houston or New York City. You just have to be on the lookout wherever you are and stay in touch with the (undis) if you think you need more support. Next please. \r\n Well, that concludes our presentation. And I turn it back over now to Linda to continue on with the next part of the presentation. Thank you so much for your attention. We will be here listening and available to answer your questions. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Okay. Great. I think we have a representative from Export-Import Bank who would also like to explain a little bit about her experience. Her name is (Ziamara Kresh) of Export-Import Bank. And let’s try to get the slides here for her. \r\n (Ziamara Kresh): Thank you Linda and Maggie for such a great presentation as well as Julio. I think with the background given on doing business in Columbia, you have a great opportunity to learn a little bit more about the opportunities and why Ex-Im Bank has selected Columbia as the market of interest. \r\n For those of you that are not familiar - oh, Linda. \r\n Linda Abbruzzese: Yeah. \r\n (Ziamara Kresh): Okay. Perfect. Thank you. For those of you that are not familiar with Ex-Im Bank, the Export-Import Bank is the official - hold on. I'm sorry about that. We have an interruption. A party just walk into my office. \r\n So we are the official export agency of the United States. We are completely independent. And our mission is to support you - to support you as experts in markets where either there is a sense of potential risk be it commercial, political. We cover both sectors. \r\n Since 1934 when we were created, we have supported more than 400 billions in transactions. It is important to note that we were created in 1934 immediately after the great depression and with the purpose of supporting and creating more U.S. jobs. \r\n I'm not saying we’re in a depression but we certainly are going through difficult times and we have seen a tremendous amount of request from the banking community on Ex-Im Bank transactions.

Size standards usually are a measure of a business's number of employees or its average annual receipts. \r\n Based on those criteria, the SBA has established the following common standards for a small business, depending on its North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code: \r\n \r\n  500 employees for most manufacturing and mining industries, and \r\n $7 million in average annual receipts for most non-manufacturing industries. \r\n  \r\n There are many exceptions, but these are the primary size standards for most industries.

Europe has become a single largest market for Indonesia, with Indonesia’s market penetration in the region 39 percent of total European biodiesel import in 2011 (up from 9 percent in 2008). [August 2012] \r\n Malaysia: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n Despite very optimistic expectations just a few years ago, Malaysia’s biodiesel sector is not yet economically viable. High feedstock prices, little domestic demand, subsidized alternative petroleum based products, and stiff competition from Indonesian supplies in export markets have stymied development of Malaysia’s bio-diesel industry. A majority of the plants are idle. The Government of Malaysia has started to implement a B5 mandate (palm biodiesel), but domestic consumption is expected to remain stagnant. [August 2012] \r\n People's Republic of China: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n China’s fuel ethanol production is forecast to increase by eight percent in 2012, despite the fact that there are no new ethanol plants or mandatory-use programs for fuel ethanol or biodiesel. However for biodiesel, without government subsidies or mandatory-use programs, producers and processing plants must operate under inconsistent profit margins and price fluctuations for feed stocks. [July 2012] \r\n Thailand: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n The Thai Government has modified its 15-year Alternative Energy Development Plan, which has fallen short of achieving its short-term target. Ethanol production will likely continue to increase in 2012 and 2013 driven by strong export demand. Biodiesel production is estimated to grow steadily in 2012 and 2013 reflecting the implementing of mandatory B5 biodiesel use. [June 2012] \r\n Japan Focuses on Next Generation Biofuels  \r\n In 2011, Japanese ethanol and biodiesel production increased but remained at low levels. Imports of ethanol for fuel and other uses also increased while ETBE imports in 2011 held steady. Due to limited agricultural production, and the “food vs. fuel” debate, the Government of Japan has opted to focus determinedly on biofuels derived from cellulosic materials or other materials which do not compete with the food supply. Nevertheless, overall Japanese production of biofuels is expected to continue expanding. [June 2012] \r\n Australia: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n Imports of Biodiesel from the United States are subject to a “Countervailing Duty” and “Dumping Duty” which is expected to be in place for a total of five years and, per calculations, would expire in April 2016. Despite these measures, official trade data shows the continued importation of biodiesel from overseas suppliers, including the US and Canada. The United States and Australia are also collaborating on research and development regarding the safe use of sustainable aviation alternative fuels. [June 2012] \r\n Thailand Imposes Export Surcharge on Crude Palm Oil \r\n Thailand’s Ministry of Commerce has imposed an export surcharge of approximately $317 per metric ton on crude palm oil, effective through June 30, 2012.

In 2009, total biofuels consumption represented 6.04 percent of transportation fuels. France's national target in 2010 is 7 percent, and generally considered realistic by the industry and research centers. [December 2010] \r\n European Union: Smart Grid Primer on Regulations and Market/Policy Drivers \r\n This report explores some of the initiatives that are shaping the smart grid debate from the perspective of the European Union, with some highlights of activity or special cases in some of the member states. [November 2010] \r\n Market Brief Renewable Energy in Austria \r\n According to the European Union 20/20/20 energy and climate package of December, 2009, Austria is obliged to increase its share of renewables to 34% of gross consumption by 2020. The Austrian Energy Strategy, announced in March of 2010, aims to focus on Austria’s strengths in hydropower and biomass, as well as doubling the amount of wind energy from 10 to 20 PJ in the next ten years. [November 2010] \r\n Environmental Sector in Austria \r\n Austria is a strong industrial player in several “green tech” sectors, especially recycling and renewable energy, with more than 400 companies employing over 22,000 people and annual sales of approximately $8.4 billion (around 3.8% of total manufacturing) in 2009. Because this industry is growing quickly, experts are predicting that by the year 2030, environmental technology will account for 8-9% of all Austrian manufacturing, bringing in $41 billion in annual sales. [November 2010] \r\n Italy: LEED Green Building Certification \r\n This report covers the launch of the LEED green building certification system in Italy and its localization into the “LEED Italia” version by Green Building Council Italia. Examples of both certified and registered LEED projects in Italy are discussed and best prospects are presented for U.S. firms, whose LEED expertise is in high demand among Italian professionals and green builders. [September 2010] \r\n Bulgaria: Renewable Energy Market \r\n In order to support the development of renewable energy sources in Bulgaria, the new Law on Renewable Energy introduced a twelve-year period for mandatory purchase of the generated electricity at feed-in tariffs. As a result, demand for renewable energy equipment and technologies have been growing significantly. [September 2010] \r\n Belgium: Biogas Market Brief \r\n There are very few Belgian companies and consultancy firms that specialize in biogas. Research on biogas has come mainly from trade associations, agricultural research groups, and universities in Belgium. Materials, installations, and consultancies are often provided by foreign companies, many from Germany. Because of little competition input and maintenance costs are relatively high. Industry trends suggest that the market could benefit from low cost products and consulting services. [August 2010] \r\n Introduction of E10 may curb biodiesel consumption in Germany  \r\n The German Government has doubled to 10% the allowable amount of ethanol in gasoline. Starting January 1, 2011, E10,a gasoline mix of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent bioethanol by volume, will be freely sold in Germany. This is expected to increase bioethanol demand and imports. However, because the overall biofuel mandate remains unchanged it is also expected that increase in bioethanol market share may reduce consumption of biodiesel in Germany. [November 2010] \r\n   \r\n «Back to top» \r\n Latin America \r\n Chile’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Market – Opportunities for U.S. Exporters \r\n The fast growing economy and rising energy demand in Chile have created important opportunities for clean energy development.

[August 2012] \r\n Buenos Aires Biodiesel Tax Increase and Temporary Soybean Import Policy \r\n The Government of Argentina (GOA) recognizes that the biodiesel industry has contributed quite a bit to Argentina’s industrialization of the soy industry. In fact, production has more than tripled over the last five years and more than half of production is exported. However, last year, supplies were short because of a hard hit drought and in March 2012, members of the crushing industry asked the GOA to consider raising soybean export taxes in order to promote more incentive to crush in-country. Temporary imports of soybeans will be allowed into Argentina for the purpose of crushing in-country to fill the gap in crushing capacity. [August 2012] \r\n Honduras: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n Honduras is the only Central America country that has a law and a regulation for both biodiesel and ethanol production.

Estimates indicate that Chile must install an additional 8 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity by 2020 to meet its growing demand. Fortunately, Chile possesses some of the world’s largest potential for renewable energy, despite little development occurring to date. \r\n By 2011, Chile had installed only 0.198 GW of wind capacity, for example, despite an estimated potential of up to 10 GW. Likewise, Chile has developed only about half its biomass potential and has a small fraction of at least 2 GW of geothermal potential under development. Chile’s solar potential is one of the largest in the world and – like other renewable energy technologies – has been largely undeveloped. \r\n Chile’s new National Energy Strategy contains six pillars: energy efficiency; renewable energy; traditional fossil fuels; smart grid; competition in electricity distribution; and regional electricity distribution. As such, the mission will occur at an opportune time, as Chilean policy makers seek to establish policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. \r\n MISSION GOALS \r\n The trade policy mission combines the policy development and advocacy efforts of a traditional trade policy mission with networking and business outreach opportunities for participating firms. The delegation will have a unique opportunity to meet government officials, discuss policy concerns, and suggest creative solutions to Chile’s energy challenges. Several topics pertinent to the creation of a thriving renewable energy market will be addressed, including: \r\n \r\n  Establishment of incentives to help Chile meet the goals of its National Energy Strategy; \r\n Development of interconnection standards and feed-in tariffs that would attract global investment and provide an incentive for development; \r\n Mapping of renewable energy resources; \r\n Strengthening of policy and regulatory cooperation between the United States and Chile; and \r\n Development of local financing institutions to further encourage development. \r\n  \r\n SCHEDULE OF EVENTS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Date \r\n\r\n\r\n Event \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Sunday, April 14 \r\n\r\n\r\n Briefing by Embassy Santiago to mission participants (TBC) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Monday, April 15 \r\n\r\n\r\n Meetings with Chilean Government officials (TBC) \r\n Networking reception (TBC) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Tuesday, April 16 \r\n\r\n\r\n Participate in a symposium on Chilean RE\u0026amp;EE opportunities hosted by the U.S.-Chile Energy Business Council of the American Chamber of Commerce in Chile (TBC) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n **Additional details on the mission’s schedule will be filled in as appropriate. \r\n PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS \r\n All parties interested in participating in the trade mission must complete and submit an application package for consideration by the Department of Commerce.

[August 2012] \r\n Buenos Aires Biodiesel Tax Increase and Temporary Soybean Import Policy \r\n The Government of Argentina (GOA) recognizes that the biodiesel industry has contributed quite a bit to Argentina’s industrialization of the soy industry. In fact, production has more than tripled over the last five years and more than half of production is exported. However, last year, supplies were short because of a hard hit drought and in March 2012, members of the crushing industry asked the GOA to consider raising soybean export taxes in order to promote more incentive to crush in-country. Temporary imports of soybeans will be allowed into Argentina for the purpose of crushing in-country to fill the gap in crushing capacity. [August 2012] \r\n Germany: Debate over E10 fuel in light of drought in the United States \r\n The German Minister of Development and Economic Cooperation is positioning himself as an opponent of bioethanol, using current reports about the drought in the United States and its potential to drive up food prices. In an interview with a German news TV station he called for a halt in sales of “E10” gasoline. However, so far he has not received backing from other German ministries. [August 2012] \r\n Indonesia: 2012 Biofuels Report  \r\n Indonesian biodiesel production increased significantly in 2011. It is predicted that it will increase in 2012 and 2013. Domestic users consumed 10 percent of the increased biodiesel production, with almost 90 percent of the biodiesel going to overseas markets. Europe has become a single largest market for Indonesia, with Indonesia’s market penetration in the region 39 percent of total European biodiesel import in 2011 (up from 9 percent in 2008). [August 2012] \r\n Malaysia: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n Despite very optimistic expectations just a few years ago, Malaysia’s biodiesel sector is not yet economically viable. High feedstock prices, little domestic demand, subsidized alternative petroleum based products, and stiff competition from Indonesian supplies in export markets have stymied development of Malaysia’s bio-diesel industry. A majority of the plants are idle. The Government of Malaysia has started to implement a B5 mandate (palm biodiesel), but domestic consumption is expected to remain stagnant. [August 2012] \r\n Department of Energy: Developments in U.S. Ethanol Exports \r\n The United States exported record levels of ethanol through the end of 2011 and looks to be on track to continue exporting significant volumes during 2012. While there are a number of complexities and potential renewable fuel mixes in store for the United States in 2012, it is likely to be a net exporter of ethanol, albeit at lower levels than in 2011. [July 2012] \r\n Honduras: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n Honduras is the only Central America country that has a law and a regulation for both biodiesel and ethanol production. Honduras’ increase in the production of African palm oil provides opportunities for biodiesel. Additionally, new initiatives have been established such as the production of biofuel from tilapia by-products and jatropha, the production of biogas sold for carbon credits, and the production of biomass to burn for electricity. However, there is no commercial production of biofuels due to market constraints. [July 2012] \r\n Argentina: 2012 Biofuels Report  \r\n This report reviews Argentine biodiesel production and consumption projections. The closing of the Spanish market, Argentina’s top export destination, is forecast to hurt overall exports. The government is contemplating increasing the mandate mix from 7 to 10 percent. The report also predicts bioethanol production for 2013 including the incorporation of five new grain-based plants. [July 2012] \r\n People's Republic of China: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n China’s fuel ethanol production is forecast to increase by eight percent in 2012, despite the fact that there are no new ethanol plants or mandatory-use programs for fuel ethanol or biodiesel. However for biodiesel, without government subsidies or mandatory-use programs, producers and processing plants must operate under inconsistent profit margins and price fluctuations for feed stocks. [July 2012] \r\n Russian Federation: Biofuels Sector Update \r\n The Russian government outlined as a national objective making the country 40 percent more energy-efficient by 2020. However as one of the world's leading producers and exporters of oil and gas, biofuels have an insignificant share in the overall energy production matrix of Russia with an estimate of 1.2 percent, and biomass accounting for only 0.5 percent. As a result, the emerging Russian biofuels industry is driven primarily by growing demand for biofuels from Europe. [July 2012] \r\n Canada: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n As the Canadian biofuels industry is preparing to comply with requirements, production of ethanol and biodiesel have increased over the past year. Ethanol production in 2012 is estimated to increase 40% from 2011 levels, and biodiesel production is estimated to increase nearly 80%. At this time, the Canadian biofuels industry remains below estimates to meet the federal standards, and limited production suggests that Canada will not soon become a major player in the global ethanol market. [July 2012] \r\n Colombian Biofuels Use Reaching E10 and B10 Levels \r\n In 2011, ethanol production recovered to 351 million liters due to an increase in sugarcane supply, and in 2012 production is expected to reach 355 million liters. Biodiesel production also recovered to 537 million liters in 2011.The expansion of 300,000 liters in production capacity is expected to boost ethanol production to 400 million liters in 2013. Blends target of B10 and E10 are yet to be reached for the entire country; Colombia is not expected to export biofuels in the next two years. [July 2012] \r\n The European Union: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n EU Member States (MS) are mandated to reach a minimum of 10% for renewable energy consumed in transport in 2020. In 2011, about a fifth of the domestic use of biofuels was imported from outside the EU. Despite a reclassification of bioethanol blends to a higher tariff rate, 2012 and 2013 imports from the United States are anticipated to remain around 1 billion liters. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in 2013, overall EU imports of biodiesel are expected to decrease as a result of enforcement of the Spanish quota system, which only accepts biodiesel produced in the EU. The European Commission (EC) expects heat and power production from biomass to play an important role in meeting the 20% target for renewable energy use by 2020 and in the future reduction of CO2 emissions in Europe. [June 2012] \r\n Thailand: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n The Thai Government has modified its 15-year Alternative Energy Development Plan, which has fallen short of achieving its short-term target. Ethanol production will likely continue to increase in 2012 and 2013 driven by strong export demand. Biodiesel production is estimated to grow steadily in 2012 and 2013 reflecting the implementing of mandatory B5 biodiesel use. [June 2012] \r\n Japan Focuses on Next Generation Biofuels  \r\n In 2011, Japanese ethanol and biodiesel production increased but remained at low levels. Imports of ethanol for fuel and other uses also increased while ETBE imports in 2011 held steady. Due to limited agricultural production, and the “food vs. fuel” debate, the Government of Japan has opted to focus determinedly on biofuels derived from cellulosic materials or other materials which do not compete with the food supply. Nevertheless, overall Japanese production of biofuels is expected to continue expanding. [June 2012] \r\n El Salvador: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n The current Government of El Salvador (GOES) has not approved the Ethanol Law created by the previous administration. The GOES has not made a decision on the gasoline-ethanol mix ratio; and high international sugar prices have decreased interest in the sugarcane industry to lobby for the ethanol law. There are currently several bio-fuel initiatives being implemented to produce bio-diesel. [June 2012] \r\n Paraguay: 2012 Biofuels Report  \r\n While ethanol in Paraguay is expected to reach a record, biodiesel production and consumption is still forecast to remain well below the current mandate of 1 percent. The pricing of biodiesel and some quality/standard problems in the past have discouraged the local expansion of production. Two new large oilseeds crushing plants will be on-line in 2013/14, duplicating the country’s production capacity. This could encourage the government to set conditions to start meeting the delayed mandates. [June 2012] \r\n Ecuador Biofuel Industry, Bioethanol, Biodiesel, Production, Forecast 2012 \r\n Ecuador’s executive branch of government has been very keen on speaking up about the need for a biofuels policy and biofuels programs. However, despite the interest of the private sector as well, no biofuels policy exists at the moment. The Government of Ecuador is undertaking pilot projects to use bioethanol for the city of Guayaquil and jathropha biodiesel for the Galapagos Islands. [June 2012] \r\n Peru: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n This report reviews expected 2012 production of ethanol and biodiesel in Peru, as well as forecasts for 2013. [June 2012] \r\n A big splash of Ethanol and a drop of Biodiesel in Guatemala \r\n In 2011, Guatemala increased its installed alcohol capacity; derived from sugarcane processing, most of Guatemala's ethanol is exported to Europe. Biodiesel production is extremely limited due to a lack of commercial feedstock. Guatemala's government is considering various biofuel strategies, but has not taken any specific action. [June 2012] \r\n Australia: 2012 Biofuels Report \r\n Imports of Biodiesel from the United States are subject to a “Countervailing Duty” and “Dumping Duty” which is expected to be in place for a total of five years and, per calculations, would expire in April 2016. Despite these measures, official trade data shows the continued importation of biodiesel from overseas suppliers, including the US and Canada. The United States and Australia are also collaborating on research and development regarding the safe use of sustainable aviation alternative fuels. [June 2012] \r\n Thailand Imposes Export Surcharge on Crude Palm Oil \r\n Thailand’s Ministry of Commerce has imposed an export surcharge of approximately $317 per metric ton on crude palm oil, effective through June 30, 2012. According to the report, the move came following government action in April to import 40,000 tons of semirefined palm oil, which was done to alleviate shortages and increasing prices.
