 Powerscreen Receives Assistance and Award from the Department of Commerce 
 Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Powerscreen Sales and Rentals are official suppliers of a multitude of global markets - from mining, quarrying and aggregate extraction to construction and demolition waste recycling. 
 In early 2008 TS Mona Musa and UPS Account Executive Dean Johnson jointly counseled Edwards O’Donnell on a shipment held at Venezuelan Customs. The buyer had concerns about the duties and taxes required to release the equipment ordered. TS Musa promptly got O’Donnell in contact with the Trade Information Center to identify the corresponding HS number and applicable taxes. According to this information, the shipment should have incurred about 22% in VAT- which is significantly less than the amount being charged. TIC specialist Randy Mye also added that the importer probably needed to be pre-approved for importation through “Cadivi” , a foreign exchange body in Venezuela before the Funds could be transferred back to the USA. 
 This information enabled O’Donnell to manage expectations of his Venezuelan buyers and provide them with the expected taxes applicable at time of import. This shipment was finally released from customs and O’Donnell adds that knowing this information has enabled them to cut shipping time from 46 days down to 9 days. Powerscreen has made 2 additional shipments to Venezuela since receiving this information and look forward to significant growth in Latin American markets. 
 With its network of offices across the United States and in more than 80 countries, the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration utilizes its global presence and international marketing expertise to help U.S. companies sell their products and services worldwide.
