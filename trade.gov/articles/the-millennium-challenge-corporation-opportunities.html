<div class="content"> The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a United States Government corporation designed to work with some of the poorest countries in the world. MCC is based on the principle that aid is most effective when it reinforces good governance, economic freedom and investments in people. After an MCC partner country signs what is called a “Compact”, it begins implementing its projects aimed at reducing poverty. During that implementation, the country will need to procure various goods, works and services.
