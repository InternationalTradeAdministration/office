  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged by Congress with protecting the nation's land, air, and water resources. Under a mandate of environmental laws, the Agency strives to formulate and implement regulatory and support actions leading to a balance between human activities and the ability of ecosystems to support and sustain life. To meet this mandate, the EPA Office of Research and Development and the Office of Wastewater Management (OWM) in the EPA Office of Water provide information and technical support to solve environmental problems today and to build a knowledge base necessary to protect public health and the environment well into the future. The technical manuals below will help municipal utility owners and operators, state permit writers and regulators plan cost-effective nutrient removal projects for municipal wastewater treatment facilities. 
 Nutrient Control Design Manual 
 The purpose of this EPA design manual is to provide updated, state-of-the-technology design guidance on nitrogen and phosphorus control at municipal Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs).
