<div class="content"> Exporters frequently face legal issues common in running a business, such as those relating to agent/distributor agreements, protection of intellectual property rights and appropriate licensing arrangements. Â However, there are unique legal issues involving corrupt business practives that can significant consequences on the viability of a successful export transaction. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA 
 U.S. firms seeking to do business in foreign markets must be familiar with the FCPA. In general, the FCPA prohibits American companies from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The Department of Justice is the chief enforcement agency, with a coordinate role played by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Office of General Counsel of the Department of Commerce also answers general questions of U.S. exporters concerning the FCPA's basic requirements and constraints. 
 Anti-Boycott Regulations 
 The United States has an established policy of opposing restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries friendly to the United States. In general, anti-boycott regulations prohibit U.S. persons from participating in foreign boycotts or taking actions that further or support such boycotts. The laws are administered by the Bureau of Industry and Security. 
 Anti-Dumping 
 If a company exports a product at a price lower than the price it normally charges on its own home market, it could be said to be "dumping" the product. Opinions differ as to whether or not this is unfair competition, but many governments take action against dumping in order to defend their domestic industries. The World Trade Organization (WTO) under the "Anti-Dumping Agreement" does not regulate the actions of companies engaged in "dumping." The agreement focuses on how governments can or cannot react to dumping -- it disciplines anti-dumping actions. This is different from the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures which disciplines the use of subsidies. The Agreement regulates the actions countries can take to counter the effects of subsidies and allows a country to use the WTO's dispute-settlement procedure to seek the withdrawal of the subsidy or the removal of its adverse effects.
