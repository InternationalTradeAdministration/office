The policies below enable you to offer credit to your international buyers and access working capital funds. \r\n  The Express Insurance Program is a \"named buyer\" policy that simplifies small business access to export credit risk insurance on their foreign accounts receivable. It also has a streamlined online application provides a policy quote and credit decisions up to $300,000 on foreign buyers within five workdays (buyer credit requests exceeding $300,000 will require additional processing time). \r\n The Small Business Export Credit Insurance Policy is specifically designed for small, financially viable businesses that are new to exporting, or have only occasionally exported. It can help increase an exporter's international sales by extending competitive credit terms while minimizing risks. \r\n The Multi-Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policy enables U.S. exporters to reduce their risk of selling on credit terms by insuring their export accounts receivable against default or non-payment. The policy can help increase international sales by extending competitive credit terms to foreign buyers while minimizing risks. \r\n The Short-Term Single-Buyer Export Credit Insurance Policy allows exporters to insure specific, short-term foreign receivables against loss due to commercial and specified political risks on a selective basis. \r\n Ex-Im Bank offers U.S. leasers the opportunity to expand their overseas leasing programs by providing comprehensive insurance for both the stream of lease payments and the fair market value of the leased products. \r\n  Insure Investment Transactions with OPIC \r\n Political risk insurance is available to U.S. investors, contractors, exporters and financial institutions involved in international transactions. Political risk insurance can cover currency inconvertibility, expropriation and political violence, and is available for investments in new ventures, expansions of existing enterprises, privatizations and acquisitions with positive developmental benefits.

Export factoring is offered under an agreement between the factor and the exporter, in which the factor purchases the exporter's short-term foreign accounts receivable for cash at a discount from the face value, normally without recourse, and assumes the risk on the ability of the foreign buyer to pay, and handles collections on the receivables. Thus, by virtually eliminating the risk of nonpayment by foreign buyers, factoring allows the exporter to offer open accounts, improves liquidity position, and boosts competitiveness in the global marketplace. \r\n Factoring foreign accounts receivables can be a viable alternative to export credit insurance, long-term bank financing, expensive short-term bridge loans or other types of borrowing that will create debt on the balance sheet. This method may be useful for more experienced exporters that are involved in multiple transactions and have a certain volume of yearly international sales. For more details on how factoring works and its pros and cons see Chapter 9 of the Trade Finance Guide. To find a factor, contact the Factors Chain International or the International Factoring Association. \r\n A forfaiter is a specialized finance firm or a department in banks offers non-recourse export financing through the purchase of medium-term trade receivables. Similar to factoring, forfaiting virtually eliminates the risk of nonpayment, once the goods have been delivered to the foreign buyer in accordance with the terms of sale. However, unlike factors, forfaiters typically work with the exporter who sells capital goods, commodities, or large projects and needs to offer periods of credit from 180 days to up to seven years. \r\n In forfaiting, receivables are normally guaranteed by the importer's bank, allowing the exporter to take the transaction off the balance sheet to enhance its key financial ratios. Forfeiting typically requires a bank guarantee for the foreign buyer. It allows opening an account in markets with relatively high credit risk. It is can be more expensive than commercial bank financing. For more information on forfaiting see Chapter 10 the Trade Finance Guide. To find a forfaiter, you may contact the Association of Trade and Forfaiting in the Americas, Inc. or the International Forfaiting Association.

There are three types of cash- in advance- payment method: wire transfer, credit card, and payment by check. Wire transfers and credit cards are the most commonly used cash-in-advance options available to exporters. However, requiring payment in advance is the least attractive option for the buyer, as this method creates cash flow problems. Foreign buyers are also concerned that the goods may not be sent if payment is made in advance. Thus, exporters that insist on this method of payment as their sole method of doing business may find themselves losing out to competitors who may be willing to offer more attractive payment terms. For more detailed information on the cash-in-advance payment method see Chapter 2 of the Trade Finance Guide. \r\n Letters of Credit \r\n Letters of credit (LCs) are among the most secure instruments available to international traders. An LC is a commitment by a bank on behalf of the buyer that payment will be made to the exporter provided that the terms and conditions have been met, as verified through the presentation of all required documents. The buyer pays its bank to render this service. An LC is useful when reliable credit information about a foreign buyer is difficult to obtain, but you are satisfied with the creditworthiness of your buyer's foreign bank. An LC also protects the buyer since no payment obligation arises until the goods have been shipped or delivered as promised. The letters of credit can take many forms: irrevocable or revocable, confirmed, or special (transferable, revolving or standby). For more detailed information on the payment method involving various types of letters of credit see Chapter 3 of the Trade Finance Guide. To obtain a letter of credit, contact the international division of your local bank. Alternatively, see the list of commercial banks listed by state on the U.S. Export-Import Bank's Lender Referral List. \r\n Documentary Collections \r\n A documentary collection is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of a payment to the remitting bank (exporter's bank), which sends documents to a collecting bank (importer's bank), along with instructions for payment. Funds are received from the importer and remitted to the exporter through the banks involved in the collection in exchange for those documents. Documentary collections involve the use of a draft that requires the importer to pay the face amount either on sight (document against payment -- D/P) or on a specified date in the future (document against acceptance -- D/A). The draft lists instructions that specify the documents required for the transfer of title to the goods. Although banks do act as facilitators for their clients under collections, documentary collections offer no verification process and limited recourse in the event of nonpayment. Drafts are generally less expensive than letters of credit. For more detailed information on the letter of credit payment method see chapter go to Chapter 4 of the Trade Finance Guide. To obtain a letter of credit, contact the international division of your bank. Alternatively, see the list of commercial banks listed by state on the U.S. Export-Import Bank's Lender Referral List. \r\n Open Account \r\n An open account transaction means that the goods are shipped and delivered before payment is due, usually in 30 to 90 days. Obviously, this is the most advantageous option to the importer in cash flow and cost terms, but it is consequently the highest risk option for an exporter. Due to the intense competition for export markets, foreign buyers often press exporters for open account terms since the extension of credit by the seller to the buyer is more common abroad. Therefore, exporters who are reluctant to extend credit may face the possibility of the loss of the sale to their competitors. However, with the use of one or more of the appropriate trade finance techniques, such as export working capital financing, government-guaranteed export working capital programs, export credit insurance, export factoring, the exporter can offer open competitive account terms in the global market while substantially mitigating the risk of nonpayment by the foreign buyer. For more detailed information on the open account payment method see Chapter 5 of the Trade Finance Guide. \r\n Need Help Getting Paid Overseas?

An automobile used for pleasure is considered a consumer good. An automobile used by a business person to deliver wares is considered a capital good. \r\n Consumption \r\n The purchase and utilization of goods or services for the gratification of human desires or in the production of other goods or services. The consumer may be an individual, a business firm, a public body, or other entity. \r\n Countervailable Subsidy \r\n Foreign governments subsidize industries when they provide financial assistance to benefit the production, manufacture or exportation of goods. Subsidies can take many forms, such as direct cash payments, credits against taxes, and loans at terms that do not reflect market conditions. The statute and regulations establish standards for determining when an unfair subsidy has been conferred. The amount of subsidies the foreign producer receives from the government is the basis for the subsidy rate by which the subsidy is offset, or \"countervailed,\" through higher import duties. \r\n Countervailing Duties (CVD) \r\n Specific duties imposed on imports to offset the benefits of subsidies to producers or exporters in the exporting country. \r\n Demand \r\n The quantity of an economic good that will be bought at a given price at a particular time in a specific market. Demand in a market economy is strongly influenced by consumer preference or the individual choices of many independent buyers, based upon their perceptions of value for price. \r\n Dumping \r\n Dumping occurs when a foreign producer sells a product in the United States at a price that is below that producer's sales price in the country of origin (home market), or at a price that is lower than the cost of production. The difference between the price (or cost) in the foreign market and the price in the U.S. market is called the dumping margin. Unless the conduct falls within the legal definition of dumping as specified in U.S. law, a foreign producer selling imports at prices below those of American products is not necessarily dumping. \r\n Exports \r\n Goods and services produced in one country and sold in other countries in exchange for goods and services, gold, foreign exchange, or settlement of debt. Countries devote their domestic resources to exports because they can obtain more goods and services with the international exchange they earn from the exports than they would from devoting the same resources to the domestic production of goods and services. \r\n Free Trade \r\n A theoretical concept that assumes international trade unhampered by government measures such as tariffs or nontariff barriers. The objective of trade liberalization is to achieve “freer trade” rather than “free trade,” it being generally recognized among trade policy officials that some restrictions on trade are likely to remain in effect for the foreseeable future. \r\n Goods \r\n Inherently useful and relatively scarce articles or commodities produced by the manufacturing, mining, construction, and agricultural sectors of the economy. Goods are important economically because they may be exchanged for money or other goods and services \r\n Harmonization \r\n The process of making procedures or measures applied by different countries—especially those affecting international trade—more compatible, as by effecting simultaneous tariff cuts applied by different countries so as to make their tariff structures more uniform. \r\n Imports \r\n The inflow of goods and services into a country’s market for consumption. A country enhances its welfare by importing a broader range of higher-quality goods and services at lower cost than it could produce domestically. The expansion of world trade since the end of World War II has therefore been a principal factor underlying a general rise in living standards in most countries. \r\n Incoterms \r\n Incoterms® are a set of rules which define the responsibilities of sellers and buyers for the delivery of goods under sales contracts for domestic and international trade. They are published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and are widely used in international commercial transactions. The most recent version of Incoterms®, Incoterms® 2010, was launched in September 2010 and became effective January 1, 2011. \r\n The two main categories of Incoterms® 2010 are now organized by modes of transport. Used in international as well as in domestic contracts for the first time, the new groups aim to simplify the drafting of contracts and help avoid misunderstandings by clearly stipulating the obligations of buyers and sellers. \r\n Group 1. Incoterms® that apply to any mode of transport are: \r\n  \nEXW Ex Works \r\n \nFCA Free Carrier \r\n \nCPT Carriage Paid To \r\n \nCIP Carriage and Insurance Paid To \r\n \nDAT Delivered at Terminal \r\n \nDAP Delivered at Place \r\n \nDDP Delivered Duty Paid \r\n  Group 2. Incoterms® that apply to sea and inland waterway transport only: \r\n  \nFAS Free Alongside Ship \r\n \nFOB Free on Board \r\n \nCFR Cost and Freight \r\n \nCIF Cost, Insurance, and Freight \r\n  View Incoterms 2010 with Definitions \r\n Market Access \r\n The ability of domestic providers of goods and services to penetrate a related market in a foreign country. The extent to which the foreign market is accessible generally depends on the existence and extent of trade barriers \r\n Market Economy \r\n The national economy of a country that relies on market forces to determine levels of production, consumption, investment, and savings without government intervention. \r\n Market Forces \r\n Shifts in demand and supply that are reflected in changing relative prices, thus serving as indicators and guides for enterprises that make investment, purchase, and sales decisions. \r\n Services \r\n Economic activities — such as transportation, banking, insurance, tourism, telecommunications, advertising, entertainment, data processing, and consulting—that normally are consumed as they are produced, as contrasted with economic goods that are more tangible. Service industries, which are usually labor intensive, have become increasingly important in domestic and international trade since at least the 1920s. Services account for about two-thirds of the economic activity of the United States and for a rapidly increasing percentage of U.S. exports. \r\n Subsidy \r\n An economic benefit granted by a government to domestic producers of goods or services, often to strengthen their competitive position. \r\n Supply \r\n The quantity of an economic good that sellers will make available at a given price at a certain time in a specific market. A supply schedule indicates the quantity of an economic good that might enter the market at all possible prices at a particular time. Supply in a market economy is principally determined by the response of many individual entrepreneurs and firms to their perceptions of opportunities for earning profits. \r\n Surplus \r\n The amount of a commodity that cannot be absorbed in a given market at the existing price. \r\n Tariff \r\n A duty (or tax) levied upon goods transported from one customs area to another either for protective or revenue purposes. Tariffs raise the prices of imported goods, thus making them generally less competitive within the market of the importing country unless that country does not produce the items so tariffed. \r\n Trade Barriers \r\n Government laws, regulations, policies, or practices that either protect domestic products from foreign competition or artificially stimulate exports of particular domestic products.

To determine if a license is needed to export your product, exporters must first determine whether an Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) fits their product. \r\n The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has the licensing authority over the export and re-export of items considered to be \"dual-use.\" Dual-use items generally have both commercial and military applications. These items are controlled to further the national security, foreign policy, and nonproliferation interests of the United States. \r\n The five character alpha-numeric ECCN identifies the technology level and the capabilities of an item which, in combination with the country of destination, customer, and the intended application, determine if an export license is required for a specific transaction or whether an item can be exported without a license. The ECCN must be determined prior to shipment. \r\n Once the ECCN has been identified, an exporter can consult the Commerce Control List (CCL) and the Country List, contained in the Export Administration Regulations, to find out if the product requires a license, why the product is controlled, and whether a license exception or NLR will apply. \r\n Firms exporting products that are subject to EAR must apply for an export license, unless the transaction qualifies for a license exception or \"No License Required\" (NLR) treatment. When a Shippers Export Declaration (SED) is required for the export transaction (for shipments over $2,500 value, those requiring an export license, or those going to countries that have been designated as terrorist supporting countries), the ECCN must be provided. If an export license is not required, then NLR is entered on the SED, unless the item is controlled for anti-terrorism. \r\n How Do I Get An ECCN? \r\n There are several ways to determine the ECCN for your product: \r\n  Contact the manufacturer, producer or developer of the product. If the item has been exported in the past, the producer may already know the ECCN or if the item qualifies for a license exception. Consult the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which can be found at the BIS website and in most libraries, in the Code of Federal Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 730-774. \r\n Consult the CCL and determine your ECCN by finding the appropriate category and group that most accurately describe your product. Begin with a review of the general characteristics of your item, which will guide you to the appropriate section of the CCL. After you have identified the category and group, match the specific characteristics of your item to an ECCN. (Note: For ease of reference and classification purposes, items subject to the EAR which are not listed in the CCL under a specific ECCN are designated as EAR99, see more details on ECCN categories below). \r\n Request an official ECCN classification on the BIS Multipurpose Application form BIS-748P. Classification requests are processed within three to four weeks but vary on a case-by-case basis. Only typed original copies are accepted. Form BIS-748P can be obtained by contacting the BIS’s Form Request Service at (202) 482-3332. Fax requests may be sent to (202) 219-9182. Include your name, address, telephone number and specify which forms are needed. (If you need to request additional forms, use the address below and make the request to the Forms Distribution Unit). \r\n Mail your completed BIS- 748P Form to: U. S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security Office of Exporter Services P. O. Box 273, Washington, D. C., 20044. Attn: Classification Request. Request an ECCN electronically through the Electronic Request for Item Classification (ERIC), which is available through the Electronic Licensing Application Information Network (ELAIN). Prior to submitting an electronic request, you must first obtain a PIN number. Information on all electronic services, including receiving a PIN, can be found on the BIS website, or by contacting the BIS Operations Support Division at (202) 482-3290. \r\n  After determining an ECCN you may apply for a license using the Simplified Network Application Process (SNAP) through which exporters can submit license applications directly to BIS via the Internet. Additional information on SNAP and how to request a PIN can be found on the BIS website. SNAP is a free service to the exporting community. \r\n Are There Any Requirements For Classification Requests? \r\n Each request is limited to five items. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for several related products if the relationship between the products is substantiated and documented. \r\n Attach descriptive literature, brochures, technical papers or specifications to assist licensing officials in determining the correct ECCN. On form BIS-748P, complete Blocks 1 through 5, Block 14, Block 22(b) (only if the item is a computer), Block 22(c), Block 22(i) and Block 22(j). If more space is needed for the technical description required in Block 22(j), use Appendix Form 748PA for additional space. An attempt should be made to identify the item. Once completed, the form should be signed and submitted to BIS at the above address. \r\n To submit the classification request or license application electronically, access the ELAIN or SNAP services via the BIS website or call the Export Counseling service at (202) 482-4811. \r\n How Do I Find My Product On The Commerce Control List (CCL)? \r\n The CCL is divided into 10 categories. The first (numerical) character in the ECCN identifies the category within which the entry falls, for example: 3A001 is in Category 3, Electronics. The following is a list of CCL categories: \r\n  Nuclear Materials, Facilities and Equipment and Miscellaneous \r\n Materials, Chemicals, Microorganisms, and Toxins \r\n Materials Processing \r\n Electronics \r\n Computers \r\n Telecommunications and Information Security \r\n Sensors \r\n Navigation and Avionics \r\n Marine \r\n Propulsion Systems, Space Vehicles and Related Equipment \r\n  Within each category, items are arranged by group. The second (alpha) character indicates under which of the five groups the item is listed, for example, 3A001 would be in group A, Equipment, Assemblies and Components. Each category contains the same five groups, which are: \r\n A Equipment, Assemblies and Components; B Test, Inspection and Production Equipment; C Materials; D Software; E Technology. \r\n The remaining digits identify the reasons for control associated with the item. It is not essential that you be able to identify which reasons for control are associated with particular digits. However, if interested, you can find an explanation in 738.2(d) of the EAR. \r\n A brief description of the product is provided next to each ECCN. Following this description are the \"License Requirements,\" \"License Exceptions,\" and \"List of Items Controlled\" sections. \r\n After you have determined where your product fits within the CCL, use the information in the \"License Requirements\" section to determine if a license is required. You also must check the Country Chart (Supplement 1 to Part 740 of the EAR) to ensure that a license is not required for shipments going to that country. It is possible that the product itself may not require a license, but due to the country of destination or end-user, the shipment may still need an export license. \r\n For products that do require a license, the CCL also lists the reasons for control of the product: AT is Anti- Terrorism; CB is Chemical and Biological Weapons; CC is Crime Control; EI is Encryption Item; MT is Missile Technology; NS is National Security; NP is Nuclear Nonproliferation; RS is Regional Stability; SS is Short Supply; XP is High Level Computers; and SI is Significant Items. \r\n Where Can I Go For Further Assistance? \r\n For additional information concerning export licenses, determining an ECCN and/or filling out Form 748P, you may contact the BIS Office of Exporter Services, Outreach and Educational Services Division at (202) 482-4811, or by fax at (202) 482-3617. The BIS Western Regional Offices can be reached at (949) 660-0144 in Southern California or at (408) 998-7402 in Northern California.

Since that time there have been six different revisions and updates to the Incoterms. The Incoterms provide a common set of rules for the most often used international terms of trade. \r\n The goal of the Incoterms is to alleviate or reduce confusion over interpretations of shipping terms, by outlining exactly who is obligated to take control of and/or insure goods at a particular point in the shipping process. Further, the terms will outline the obligations for the clearance of the goods for export or import, and requirements on the packing of items. The Incoterms are used quite frequently in international contracts, and a specific version of the Incoterms should be referenced in the text of the contract. \r\n Although the Incoterms are widely used and exceedingly handy, they are not meant for every type of contract. Specifically, the terms used in a contract state exactly when the shipper unloads and relinquishes obligation, and when the buyer takes over for carriage and insurance. The Incoterms are not meant to replace statements in a contract of sale that outline transfers of ownership or title to goods. Therefore, the Incoterms may not be of use when looking to resolve disputes that may arise regarding payment or ownership of goods. \r\n What are some examples of Incoterms? \r\n The 13 Incoterms fall into four different groups. These four groups are: \r\n  Departure (E) \r\n Main Carriage Unpaid (F) \r\n Main Carraige Paid (C), and \r\n Arrival (D) \r\n  Each group's letter makes up the first letter of Incoterm. For example, if your agreement with a buyer calls for the release of goods by the seller to occur at the seller's location, the Ex Works (EXW) Incoterm would be used. This term states among other things that the buyer is to take over carriage and insurance responsibilities at the sellers dock. Alternatively, if the seller were to deliver goods to the buyers dock, including all carriage and insurance, a term from the Arrival group such as DDP would be appropriate. The DDP term stands for Delivered Duty Paid and includes in its definition that the seller will deliver goods to the buyers dock with all carriage, insurance, and duties paid. DDP represents the most obligations for the seller, whereas EXW represents the least. \r\n Caution must be exercised when using Incoterms because the Incoterms relate to particular modes of transportation. For example, some of the Incoterms deal solely with transport by sea. Terms such as FOB and CIF can be used only for ocean bound freight. FOB, meaning Free on Board, translates to the shipper (seller) having upheld his/her part of the agreement when the goods pass the ship's rails at the port of exit. The receiving party (buyer) assumes risk and costs associated with the goods once they pass the ship's rail in the seller's home port. Due to the specific mention of the ship's rails, an aircraft or other mode of transport could not be used with FOB. For a shipment scheduled for delivery by air, rail, or some other form of transport with the same agreement as FOB one would need to use the Incoterm FCA, or Free Carrier. FCA can include other modes of transportation such as road, rail, interland waterway, and air. Whereas transfer under FOB takes place when the cargo passes the ship's rails, transfer with FCA occurs when delivery of goods has been made at a destination previously outlined by the buying party. \r\n Where can I learn more about INCOTERMS? \r\n The International Chamber of Commerce publishes the Incoterms and other related materials.

The ability to aggregate cargo and ship the collective membership cargo at favorable volume rates is the key to the existence of the modern day Shippers' Association.\" \r\n Shippers’ associations allow multiple shippers to pool their volumes in order to increase shipment volumes. With a larger shipment volume, the shippers’ association may be able to negotiate volume discounts or service contracts with ocean carriers on behalf of its members. \r\n Shipper's Associations can be located in many local business telephone directories or by searching the web.

This article outlines ways in which exporters can mitigate confusion and delays associated with international trade logistics. \r\n What is a freight forwarder? \r\n To comply with export documentation and shipping requirements, many exporters utilize a freight forwarder to act as their shipping agent. The forwarder advises and assists clients on how to move goods most efficiently from one destination to another. A forwarder’s extensive knowledge of documentation requirements, regulations, transportation costs and banking practices can ease the exporting process for many companies. The Federal Maritime Commission licenses U.S. forwarders for ocean operations, and some U.S. forwarders are affiliated with global organizations like the International Air Transport Association. \r\n Why should I use a freight forwarder? \r\n Whether the firm is large or small, the weight of the cargo light or heavy, the freight forwarder will take care of cargo from “dock to door” if requested to do so. This can include the correct filing of export documentation, all arrangements with carriers, packing, crating and storage needs. So, the small and medium-size exporter need not deal with many of the details involved with the logistics of exporting their goods. In addition, freight forwarders typically charge modest rates for their services and have access to shipping discounts. Given the years of experience and constant attention to detail provided by the forwarder, it may be a good investment. \r\n How can I find freight forwarder? \r\n Freight forwarders are located in most metropolitan areas. Local business telephone listings often feature a freight forwarder or transportation heading. Additionally, the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America will provide exporters with information on their members. They can be reached at:  1200 18th Street, NW, Suite 901 Washington, DC 20036, Tel: (202) 466-0222,  Privately operated forwarder listing services can be useful when looking for a local forwarder. The following websites have listings: \r\n  Directory of Freight Forwarding Services \r\n 1800Miti.com \r\n FreightGate.com \r\n FreightNet.com \r\n  What is a customs broker? \r\n A customs broker performs transactions at ports on behalf of other parties. In other words, an importer, whether into the United States or another country, hires a customs broker to guide their goods into a country. Like the forwarder, the broker will recommend efficient means for clearing goods through the maze of customs entry protocol. The broker can also estimate the landed costs for shipments entering the country. U.S. exporters typically do not book shipments directly with a foreign customs broker, because freight forwarders often partner with customs brokers overseas who will clear goods that the forwarder ships to the overseas port. Conversely, those same foreign customs brokers contract the services of the domestic freight forwarder when the goods are headed in the opposite direction.   The transactions negotiated for the importer will include the entry of goods into a customs territory, payment of taxes and duties and duty drawback or refunds of any kind. Furthermore, the broker has knowledge of regulations not only from the corresponding customs authority, but also from other regulating agencies involved in imports. \r\n What are INCOTERMS and when are they used? \r\n Incoterms is an abbreviation of International Commercial Terms, which were first published in 1936 by the International Chamber of Commerce. Since that time there have been six different revisions and updates to the Incoterms. The Incoterms provide a common set of rules for the most often used international terms of trade. The goal of the Incoterms is to alleviate or reduce confusion over interpretations of shipping terms by outlining who is obligated to take control of and/or insure goods at a particular point in the shipping process. Furthermore, the terms outline the obligations for the clearance of the goods for export or import and packing requirements. The Incoterms are used quite frequently in international contracts and an official version of the Incoterms should be referenced in the text of the contract. \r\n Although the Incoterms are widely used and exceedingly handy, they are not appropriate for every type of contract. Specifically, the terms used in a contract state exactly when the shipper unloads and relinquishes obligation and when the buyer takes over for carriage and insurance. The Incoterms are not meant to replace statements in a contract of sale that outline transfers of ownership or title to goods. Therefore, the Incoterms may not be of use when looking to resolve disputes that may arise regarding payment or ownership of goods.

Products can require many markings for shipment. For example, exporters need to put the following markings on cartons to be shipped: \r\n  Shipper's mark \r\n Country of origin (U.S.A.) \r\n Weight marking (in pounds and in kilograms) \r\n Number of packages and size of cases (in inches and centimeters) \r\n Handling marks (international pictorial symbols) \r\n Cautionary markings, such as \"This Side Up\" or \"Use No Hooks\" (in English and in the language of the country of destination) \r\n Port of entry \r\n Labels for hazardous materials (universal symbols adapted by the International Airi Transport Association and the International Maritime Organization) \r\n Ingredients (if applicable, also included in the language of the destination country). \r\n Packages should be clearly marked to prevent misunderstandings and delays in shipping. Letters are generally stenciled onto packages and containers in waterproof ink. Markings should appear on three faces of the container, preferably on the top and on the two ends or the two sides. Ant old markings must be completely removed from previously used packaging. \r\n  In addition to the port marks, the customer identification code, and an indication of origin, the marks should include the package number, gross and net weights, and dimensions. If more than one package is being shipped, the total number of packages in the shipment should be included in the markings. The exporter should also add any special handling instructions. It is a good idea to repeat these instructions in the language of the country of destination. and use standard international shipping and handling symbols. \r\n Customs regulations regarding freight labeling are strictly enforced. For example, many countries require that the country of origin be clearly labeled on each imported package. Most freight forwarders and export packing specialists can supply the necessary information regarding specific regulations.

Governments assert that pre-shipment inspections ensure that the price charged by the exporter reflects the true value of the goods, prevent substandard goods from entering their country, and mitigate attempts to avoid the payment of customs duties. \r\n The following countries currently require or request pre-shipment inspections: \r\n Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), Cote d’Ivoire, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guinea, India (see note below), Indonesia (see note below), Iran, Kenya (under review), Kuwait (see note below), Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico (see note below), Mozambique, @#$%, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, Uzbekistan. \r\n Most countries on the list above request inspections for shipments above a certain value. However, in some instances inspections are necessary for all imported products, regardless of value. \r\n In some cases, a country may require PSIs only for certain types of goods. For example, Kuwait requires PSI for regulated products valued at more than $3,000. Mexico requires a PSI for a variety of goods such as shoes, textiles, steel, and bicycles only if they do not qualify for NAFTA. Shipments to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait must contain a \"certificate of conformity\" for a small number of products. Though not referred to as a pre-shipment inspection, this certification verifies that the product conforms to the relevant standard by testing and inspecting prior to shipment from the exporting county. \r\n PSI regulations change often, and contracts for pre-shipment inspections are reviewed periodically. Exporters can contact the Commerce Department’s Trade Information Center at 1-800-USA-TRAD(E), inspection companies, or freight forwarders for more information on current regulations. \r\n Who Conducts the Inspection and Who Pays? \r\n Pre-shipment inspections are typically performed by contracted private organizations. In most cases, importers can select from a short list of these organizations when planning inspections. However, sometimes one firm is appointed to carry out inspections for a given country on an exclusive basis. The following is a list of the most widely used private inspection companies: \r\n Bivac/Bureau Veritas, Miami, FL Tel: (305) 593-7878 http://www.bivac.com \r\n Cotecna, Miami, FL Tel: (305) 828-8141 http://www.cotecna.com \r\n Intertek, Americas Tel: (800) 967-5352 http://www.intertek-fts.com \r\n SGS, Miami, FL Tel: (305) 592-0410 http://www.gts.sgsamericas.com \r\n Inspection costs are generally paid either by the importer or by the government of the importing country. However, in some cases, the inspection agency may invoice the seller in the event of supplementary inspection visits. The costs associated with presenting the goods for inspection (such as unpacking, handling, testing, sampling, repackaging) are the responsibility of the seller. \r\n Who is Responsible for Arranging the Pre-Shipment Inspection and What is the Process? \r\n Although the importer is generally responsible for arranging the pre-shipment inspection, the exporter must make the goods available for inspection in the country of origin. Delays in the process can lead to problems with the shipment and/or increased costs for the exporter. Therefore, it is in the best interest of exporters to work with their freight forwarder to ensure that all information is accurate and is provided to the inspection company immediately after notification of the requested inspection. Requirements for pre-shipment inspections are sometimes spelled out in letters of credit or other documents. \r\n Generally, the inspection company starts the inspection process once it receives a copy of the inspection order from the importing country. An inspection order states the value of goods, the name and address of the importer and the exporter, the country of supply, and the importer's declaration of customs code. The inspection company then contacts the exporter to arrange an inspection site and time. \r\n The steps of the inspection process are usually as follows: \r\n 1. The importer opens an import document or license. \r\n 2. The importer informs the inspection service in the country of import of a pending shipment, and either pays for the inspection up front or pays a percentage based on the value of the commercial invoice, depending on the terms of the importing country's inspection contract. \r\n 3. An inspection order is forwarded to the inspection company office in the country of export. \r\n 4. The inspection company contacts the exporter to arrange date, time, and location for inspection. It also requests all required shipping documents and price information (invoices). The exporter must provide these documents in a timely manner to avoid demurrage or other penalties. \r\n 5. The inspection is performed. \r\n 6. If no discrepancies are noted during the inspection, and once all final documents are received from the importer and exporter, a “Clean Report of Findings” is issued confirming the shipment’s value, customs classification, and clearance. The final documents required for issuance of the\"Clean Report of Findings\" vary by contract but most often include a final invoice and bill of lading or airway bill. \r\n 7. The goods are shipped to the importing country. \r\n 8. The importer uses the inspection report to get the imported goods released from customs. If goods reach the border of the importing country without inspection, they usually have to be re-exported to a nearby country for inspection prior to re-entry or are subject to heavy penalties. \r\n What Should I Do if a Problem or Disagreement Arises? \r\n If a disagreement arises on the findings of the pre-shipment inspection, a resolution to the discrepancy should be negotiated with the inspection company. However, if exporting to a World Trade Organization (WTO) member country, the WTO Agreement on Pre-shipment Inspection spells out the responsibilities of the exporter and the inspection company. The Agreement requires the inspection company to appoint an appeals official and comply with the Agreement guidelines when carrying out their pre-shipment inspection services for signatory countries. \r\n Detailed information on the Agreement is available at the Trade Compliance Center. \r\n Are There Additional Certification Inspections That Deal with Agricultural and Food Products? \r\n Several agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture provide inspection services when certificates are required to clear agricultural and food products through overseas customs. Sanitary and phytosanitary certificates, which are normally issued to protect U.S. consumers can also be used for international trade purposes. \r\n The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) conducts inspections of grains, pulses, oilseeds, and processed and graded commodities. Export weighing and quality inspection at the time of shipment is mandatory for bulk or bagged grains and oilseeds under the U.S. Grain Standards Act. Per NAFTA, non-waterborne shipments bound for Canada and Mexico are exempt from mandatory inspection. \r\n FGIS is required by law to perform these inspections (for a fee), and they provide the only \"official\" grain quality and quantity inspections in the United States. However, some contracts may specify that a particular private firm must perform an inspection, as well. For more information about grain inspection, please visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture website. \r\n The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) assists exporters in meeting the plant quarantine import requirements of foreign countries. They conduct inspections to certify that certain products, such as fruits, vegetables, plants, seeds, grains, and grain products are free from quarantine pests and meet the phytosanitary regulations of the importing country.

Include only goods that are made in the U.S., Canada or Mexico and are eligible for NAFTA benefits. \r\n Elimination of Canadian and Mexican duties assessed on U.S. products is one of the major ways that NAFTA assists U.S. companies. To ensure that the benefits of tariff removal accrue to NAFTA products, and not to Non-NAFTA products, NAFTA includes tough rules of origin. Only products that meet the NAFTA rules of origin are eligible for the preferential duty rates. \r\n Under NAFTA, products that qualify under the rules of origin will have zero duties when traded between the U.S. and Canada, and will have low or zero tariffs when traded between the U.S. and Mexico. An importer must submit to customs a NAFTA Certificate of Origin completed by the exporter in order to be eligible for preferential tariff rates. \r\n By filling out a NAFTA Certificate of Origin, a shipper is certifying that the covered goods meet the rules of origin, and therefore, qualify for preferential rates \r\n If the product does not qualify for NAFTA tariff preferences, the Certificate must not be completed, as the product is then usually subject to the Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate, rather than the NAFTA rate. \r\n Is a NAFTA Certificate Of Origin required for shipments to Canada And Mexico? \r\n A NAFTA Certificate of Origin is not required for shipments to Mexico or Canada. The exporter should only prepare a NAFTA Certificate if the product qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA rules of origin. \r\n A NAFTA Certificate of Origin is not required for the commercial importation of a good valued at less than US$1,000. However, for goods to qualify for NAFTA preferential duties, the invoice accompanying the commercial importation must include a statement certifying that they qualify as originating goods under the NAFTA rules of origin. The statement should be handwritten, stamped, typed on or attached to the commercial invoice. \r\n When and how do I submit a NAFTA Certificate of Origin? \r\n Once an exporter determines that the exported good will meet the NAFTA rules of origin, a NAFTA Certificate of Origin must be completed accurately and legibly. The exporter must then send the Certificate to the importer. While the Certificate does not have to accompany the shipment, the importer must have a copy of the Certificate in hand before claiming the NAFTA tariff preference at customs. Certificates of Origin may, at the discretion of the exporter, cover a single importation of goods or multiple importations of identical goods.  \r\n In some cases, an exporter may not have the NAFTA Certificate of Origin ready at the time of export; however, the importer still has up to one year after the goods go through customs to make a claim for the NAFTA tariff preference and to apply for a refund of duties paid at the time of entry. \r\n Who is responsible for determining if the product qualifies under NAFTA and for completing the certificate? \r\n The Certificate of Origin must be completed and signed by the exporter of the goods. Where the exporter is not the producer, the exporter may complete the Certificate on the basis of: knowledge that the good originates; reasonable reliance on the producer’s written representation that the good originates; or, a completed and signed Certificate of Origin for the good voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer. \r\n Exporters who are not producers often request that their producers or distributors provide them with a NAFTA Certificate of Origin as proof that the final good, or an input used in the manufacture of the final good, sold to Mexico or Canada meets the rules of origin. NAFTA does not obligate a producer who is not an exporter to provide the ultimate exporter with a NAFTA Certificate of Origin. However, if the non-exporting producer does complete the NAFTA Certificate of Origin, they are subject to the same obligations regarding record keeping, etc., as is the exporter. Even so, it is the exporter's Certificate, and not the non-exporting producer's Certificate, that must be provided to the importer. The producer’s statement should be kept in the files of the exporter as backup for their own Certificate. \r\n A distributor does not complete a Certificate of Origin for qualifying goods unless the distributor is the exporter. \r\n What is the process for determining if a product qualifies for the NAFTA preferential tariff and for completing the certificate? \r\n Completion of a NAFTA Certificate of Origin is an affirmation that the party signing the document has researched the terms of the NAFTA Agreement and has determined that the goods covered by the Certificate of Origin are “originating goods” as defined by the Agreement. Preparation of a NAFTA Certificate of Origin imposes certain legal rights, obligations and liabilities on the party signing the document and should be based on a careful inquiry into the terms of the text of the NAFTA Agreement and other relevant United States regulations. \r\n A product does not automatically qualify for NAFTA tariff treatment just because the product was manufactured in the United States or purchased from a U.S. company. The product must meet the specific NAFTA rule of origin and the exporter must complete the NAFTA Certificate of Origin before the importer can claim the NAFTA tariff rate. \r\n Follow these steps to determine if a product qualifies: \r\n Step 1. Determine the Harmonized System Number for the product being exported and its foreign part, components, and raw materials. \r\n The NAFTA rules of origin are organized under the Harmonized System (HS). HS numbers are standardized classification numbers assigned to identify a specific type of product in international trade. Customs authorities use HS numbers to apply duties and taxes. These numbers are typically six to ten digits long. The first six digits are standardized worldwide, while some governments, to further distinguish products in a certain category, use additional numbers. In the United States, ten digit classification numbers are also called Schedule B numbers. To obtain tariff information, the HS number up to the 6-digit level is required. \r\n The U.S. Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division website can be used to obtain HS numbers. If you have trouble classifying your product and need assistance, call the Census Bureau at 301-763-3047. In addition, the Schedule B: Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States can be ordered from the Government Printing Office by calling 202-512-1800. The stock number is 903-009-00000-4, and the cost of the book is $121. The CD-ROM version can also be purchased from the Census Bureau for $20 by calling 301-457-1086. \r\n Step 2. Determine the Canadian/Mexican MFN tariff for the product. If the MFN rate is zero, no NAFTA Certificate is needed. \r\n Tariff information is available from a number of sources, including your customs broker, freight forwarder, the customs authorities of Canada and Mexico. You can also call the TIC at 1-800-USA-TRAD(E) for tariff rates. \r\n Step 3. If the MFN rate is not zero, use the HS number to find the applicable rule of origin in Annex 401: General Note 12(t), and then determine if the product qualifies for a NAFTA tariff rate. \r\n When products meet the rules of origin, and therefore, qualify for NAFTA tariff benefits, they are said to \"originate\". Article 401 of the NAFTA Agreement determines which goods originate and precludes goods from other countries from obtaining those benefits by merely passing through Canada, Mexico or the United States. \r\n Chapter 4 of the NAFTA Agreement sets out most of the principles governing origin determination. The NAFTA Rules of Origin (Annex 401:General Note 12(t)) are located on the U.S. Customswebsite. \r\n Exporters must carefully research the terms of the Agreement to determine whether their goods are entitled to NAFTA benefits. They should not assume that the goods are entitled to NAFTA benefits merely because they were made in a NAFTA country. \r\n Step 4. If the product does not meet the specific Rule of Origin it does not qualify for preferential tariff treatment and the Certificate of Origin should not be completed. If it meets the Rule of Origin, complete a NAFTA Certificate of Origin. \r\n How long should copies of the Certificate Of Origin be retained? \r\n In the United States, the exporter is required to retain either the original or a copy of the Certificate for five years from the date of signature. The importer is required to retain the Certificate and all other relevant documentation for five years after the importation of the goods. Adequate records relating to the goods, and their materials and production must support the facts asserted in the Certificate. Mexican exporters must maintain a copy of the Certificate for 10 years. Canadian importers and exporters are required to keep the Certificate for six years from the time of the transaction for the importer and six years from the date of signing for the Canadian exporter. \r\n What language should be used to complete The NAFTA Certificate Of Origin? \r\n A uniform Certificate of Origin is used in all three countries and is printed in English, French or Spanish. The Certificate shall be completed in the language of the country of export or the language of the importing country, at the exporter’s discretion.

If the terms of sale make the exporter responsible for insurance, the exporter should either obtain its own policy or insure the cargo under a freight forwarder's policy for a fee. If the terms of sale make the foreign buyer responsible, the exporter should not assume (or even take the buyer's word) that adequate insurance has been obtained. If the buyer neglects to obtain adequate coverage, damage to the cargo may cause a major financial loss to the exporter. \r\n Shipments by sea are covered by marine cargo insurance. \r\n Air shipments may also be covered by marine cargo insurance or insurance may be purchased from the air carrier. \r\n Export shipments are usually insured against loss, damage, and delay in transit by cargo insurance. Carrier liability is frequently limited by international agreements. Additionally, the coverage is substantially different from domestic coverage. Arrangements for insurance may be made by either the buyer or the seller, in accordance with the terms of sale. Exporters are advised to consult with international insurance carriers or freight forwarders for more information. \r\n Although sellers and buyers can agree to different components, coverage is usually placed at 110 percent of the CIF (cost, insurance, freight) or CIP (carriage and insurance paid to) value \r\n Insuring Export Transactions and Mitigating Risk \r\n Risk in today's global marketplace can take many forms and is a very real factor in business and investor decision making.

The HS assigns 6-digit codes for general categories. This 6-digit code is known as the Harmonized System number. \r\n Countries that use the HS are allowed to define commodities at a more detailed level than 6-digits, however all definitions must be within that 6-digit framework. The U.S., for example, defines products using 10-digit codes in its Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). \r\n Export codes, also known as Schedule B numbers, are administered by the U.S. Census Bureau. \r\n Import codes are administered by the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC). \r\n Harmonized System (HS) and Schedule B numbers \r\n Harmonized System (HS) numbers are used to classify products for customs purposes. By international agreement, most countries recognize the same first 6 \"harmonized\" digits. \r\n To get a duty rate, one needs to have the complete product number used by the importing country. Since this is sometimes difficult, companies can use the Schedule B number to approximate. \r\n Schedule B Numbers are used to classify exported products in the United States and are based on the international HS system. HS numbers and Schedule B numbers will be the same up to the first 6 digits as the importing country's classification code. \r\n Why you need to know your product's Schedule B and HS numbers \r\n Exporters need to know their product's Schedule B and HS numbers for the following reasons: \r\n  To determine applicable import tariff rates and whether a product qualifies for a preferential tariff under a Free Trade Agreement. \r\n The Schedule B number is needed to complete the Shipper's Export Declaration, Certificates of Origin and other shipping documents. \r\n The HS Number may be needed on shipping documents, such as certificates of origin. \r\n  How to identify your product's Schedule B number \r\n The Census Bureau provides the Schedule B Search Engine as an online tool and an instructional video to help you classify your products. The Schedule B search tool is the most commonly used method for classifying products. \r\n \r\n After consulting the Search Engine, you can obtain further assistance on Schedule B numbers from a commodity specialist at the U.S. Census Bureau Foreign Trade Division: \r\n  Durable goods (metals, machinery, computer, electronic and other miscellaneous goods) call: 301-763-3259 \r\n Non-durable goods (food, animal, wood, paper, mineral, chemical and textile goods) call: 301-763-3484 \r\n  For assistance identifying your appropriate HS number you may also contact your local Export Assistance Center or call the Trade Information Center at 1-800-USATRAD(E). \r\n If you are having difficulty determining your Schedule B number, you may also want to review the Customs Rulings (CROSS) database. \r\n The Census Bureau produces The Schedule B: Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States that can be ordered from the Government Printing Office by calling 202-512-1800.

Exporters should keep four potential problems in mind when designing an export shipping crate: breakage, moisture, pilferage and excess weight.  Generally, cargo is carried in containers, but sometimes it is still shipped as breakbulk cargo. Besides the normal handling encountered in domestic transportation, a breakbulk shipment transported by ocean freight may be loaded aboard vessels in a net or by a sling, conveyor, or chute, that puts an added strain on the package. During the voyage, goods may be stacked on top of or come into violent contact with other goods. Overseas, handling facilities may be less sophisticated than in the United States and the cargo could be dragged, pushed, rolled, or dropped during unloading, while moving through customs, or in transit to the final destination.  Moisture is a constant concern because condensation may develop in the hold of a ship even if it is equipped with air conditioning and a dehumidifier. Another aspect of this problem is that cargo may also be unloaded in precipitation, or the foreign port may not have covered storage facilities. Theft and pilferage are added risks.  Buyers are often familiar with the port systems overseas, so they will often specify packaging requirements. If the buyer does not specify this, be sure the goods are prepared using these guidelines: \r\n \r\n  Pack in strong containers, adequately sealed and filled when possible. \r\n To provide proper bracing in the container, regardless of size, make sure the weight is evenly distributed. \r\n Goods should be palletized and when possible containerized. \r\n Packages and packing filler should be made of moisture-resistant material. \r\n To avoid pilferage, avoid writing contents or brand names on packages. Other safeguards include using straps, seals, and shrink wrapping. \r\n Observe any product-specific hazardous materials packing requirements. \r\n  \r\n One popular method of shipment is to use containers obtained from carriers or private leasing companies. These containers vary in size, material, and construction and accommodate most cargo, but they are best suited for standard package sizes and shapes. Also, refrigerated and liquid bulk containers are usually readily available. Some containers are no more than semi-truck trailers lifted off their wheels, placed on a vessel at the port of export and then transferred to another set of wheels at the port of import. \r\n Normally, air shipments require less heavy packing than ocean shipments, though they should still be adequately protected, especially if they are highly pilferable. In many instances, standard domestic packing is acceptable, especially if the product is durable and there is no concern for display packaging. In other instances, high-test (at least 250 pounds per square inch) cardboard or tri-wall construction boxes are more than adequate. \r\n Finally, because transportation costs are determined by volume and weight, specially reinforced and lightweight packing materials have been developed for exporting. Packing goods to minimize volume and weight while reinforcing them may save money, as well as ensure that the goods are properly packed. It is recommended that a professional firm be hired to pack the products if the supplier is not equipped to do so. This service is usually provided at a moderate cost.

They recommend the packing methods that will protect the merchandise during transit or can arrange to have the merchandise packed at the port or containerized. If the exporter prefers, freight forwarders can reserve the necessary space on a vessel, aircraft, train, or truck. The cost for their services is a legitimate export cost that should be included in the price charged to the customer. \r\n Once the order is ready for shipment, freight forwarders should be review all documents to ensure that everything is in order. This is of particular importance with letter of credit payment terms. They may also prepare the bill of lading and any special required documentation.

The NAFTA preference criteria are as follows: \r\n The six preference criteria A-F tell Customs authorities and the importer how the goods qualified for preferential treatment under the NAFTA. \r\n Preference Criterion A \r\n Preference Criterion A corresponds to goods wholly obtained or produced entirely in Canada, Mexico, or the United States. \r\n For a good to qualify under this criterion, it must contain no non-North American parts or materials anywhere in the production process. It is generally reserved for basic products such as those harvested, mined, or fished in the NAFTA territory, although it would include a manufactured good with no non-NAFTA inputs. \r\n As a general rule, however, Preference Criterion A rarely applies to manufactured goods. If the good contains any non-NAFTA materials, it will not qualify under Preference Criterion A. \r\n Preference Criterion B \r\n Even if your good contains non-NAFTA materials, it can qualify as B if the materials satisfy the Rules of Origin. The Annex 401 Rules of Origin are based on a change in tariff classification, a regional value-content requirement, or both. \r\n The updated Rules of Origin are located in HTSUS General Note 12(t)of the NAFTA. Agreement. Preference Criterion B is used when the good being certified is produced using materials that the producer/exporter is unable to prove qualify as originating goods in their own right. The finished product will be originating if the requirements of the applicable rule of origin are met. The requirements of the NAFTA Rules of Origin differ from good to good. \r\n Preference Criterion C \r\n This criterion corresponds to goods produced entirely in Canada, Mexico, and/or the United States exclusively from NAFTA materials. \r\n Preference Criterion C is used when the producer/exporter is able to document that the finished good is produced entirely in the NAFTA territory using only materials that would qualify in their own right. The producer/exporter should have documented proof that every raw material and component is a NAFTA good. \r\n Preference Criterion D \r\n In a very few cases a good that has not undergone the required tariff transformation can still qualify for preferential NAFTA treatment if a regional value content requirement is met. \r\n Preference Criterion E \r\n This criterion applies to certain automatic data processing goods and their parts, specified in Annex 308.1. \r\n Preference Criterion F \r\n Preference Criterion F concerns specific agricultural goods that are exported from the U.S. into Mexico.

Different tariffs are applied on different products by different countries. The average duty worldwide is about 5 percent. National sales and local taxes, and in some instances customs fees, will often be charged in addition to the tariff. The tariff, along with the other assessments, is collected at the time of customs clearance in the foreign port. Tariffs and taxes increase the cost of your product to the foreign buyer and may affect your competitiveness in the market. So knowing what the final cost to your buyer is can help you price your product for that market. In addition, your buyer may ask you to quote an estimate of these costs before making the purchase. This estimate can be made via email, phone or in the pro forma invoice. \r\n Some countries have very high duties and taxes; some have relatively low duties and taxes. If your product is primarily made in the U.S. of U.S. originating components it may qualify for duty-free entry into countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement (FTA). We currently have FTAs with more than 20 countries. Targeting FTA countries is a good market entry strategy because buyers pay less tariff for goods made in the U.S. compared with similar goods from countries without FTAs. Here are the steps for finding and calculating estimated tariffs and taxes. Keep in mind that what you get from this process is an estimate. Only the customs officers in the country where the goods clear can make the final determination. \r\n Step 1: Determine your HS or Schedule B Number \r\n The first step in determining duty and tax information is to identify the Harmonized System or Schedule B number for your product(s). More importantly, your goods won't ship without this number on key shipping documents. \r\n To help you classify your products, use the Schedule B Search Engine and an accompanying instructional video. To learn how to use the Schedule B Search Engine and other tools for finding tariff and duties, watch a pre-recorded webinar. \r\n \r\n If after viewing these learning aids you remain unsure of the best HS number for your product, you can phone U.S. Government commodity classification experts at 1-800-549-0595, and press option number 2. \r\n Step 2: Determine Tariff Rates \r\n Once you know your product's Schedule B or HS number (the first six digits of the 10 digit Schedule B number), you can determine the applicable tariff and tax rates for a specific foreign country. Here's how. The first link takes you to a third party information provider with tariff and tax information on more than 100 countries. By accessing the site through export.gov (the site you're visiting now), there is no charge to get the information you need. The data available cover shipments from the U.S. to these 100 plus countries.

Companies have several options when considering temporary importation. These include: ATA Carnets, Temporary Importation Bond (TIB) and entry with duty drawback. There is also provision for bringing “tools of trade” allowed for in the North American Free Trade Agreement. The ATA Carnet system is the most user-friendly system of temporary importation; however, there are a number of countries that do not accept carnets. In these countries, companies can post TIBs or apply for a duty drawback as an alternative means to duty free importation. \r\n What Is An ATA Carnet? \r\n ATA Carnet (a. k. a. \"Merchandise Passport\") is an international customs document accepted by 75 countries and territories. ATA Carnet allows temporary entry of goods, duty-free and tax-free, whether shipped or hand-carried. ATA Carnet system was established by international ATA convention and is governed by World Customs Organization and International Chamber of Commerce and its World Chambers Federation to encourage world trade and reduce trade barriers created by different national customs regulations. The initials \"ATA\" are from the French and English words \"Admission Temporaire/ Temporary Admission.\" U.S. Customs appointed US Council for International Business as National Guaranteeing Association (NGA). \r\n Companies are required to present carnet documentation to U. S. Customs when leaving the country and upon entry into and exit from the foreign country. Upon return, the company must again show the carnet document to U. S. Customs for duty-free entry back into the United States. The ATA carnet also serves as the registration of goods for the U.S. and eliminates the need for a U.S. Customs Certificate of Registration Form 4455. ATA Carnets cover most personal and professional goods, including commercial samples, professional equipment and goods intended for use at trade shows and exhibitions. The ATA Carnets do not cover consumable or disposable items. They are also not recommended for situations where some of the products taken abroad may be sold in a foreign country. However, they are particularly useful when a product may “travel” to several countries prior to being returned to the United States. \r\n Where Can I Use A Carnet? \r\n The ATA Carnet is accepted by many countries and territories worldwide. For a complete list of countries and territories that accept carnets, contact information as well as countries not covered by the ATA carnets contact US Council for International Business: \r\n ATA Carnet Department 1212 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036 Telephone: (866) 786-5625 or (800) 5DUTYFREE (538-8937); Fax: (212) 944-0012  Email: atacarnet@uscib.org \r\n What are the benefits of the ATA Carnet? \r\n \r\n  Eliminate duties and value-added taxes (VAT); \r\n Simplify customs procedures allowing a temporary exporter to use a single document for all customs transactions, make arrangements in advance, and at a predetermined cost; \r\n Allow for an unlimited entries/departures for up to one year; \r\n Facilitate reentry into the U.S. by eliminating the need to register the goods with U.S. Customs at the time of departure; \r\n Eliminate need to file an Electronic Export Information form (former Shipper’s Export Declaration) except for those exports that require an export license; \r\n Eliminate the need for Temporary Importation Under Bond (TIB). \r\n  \r\n Note of caution: ATA Carnets DO NOT exempt the holders from obtaining necessary licenses or permits.) \r\n How Do I Apply For an ATA Carnet? \r\n ATA carnet application is a three-part process. \r\n \r\n  General list \r\n Carnet application, and \r\n Security deposit. \r\n  \r\n ATA Carnets may be obtained from the USCIB or from two officially-appointed Carnet Service Providers: Boomerang Freight Solutions and Roanoke Trade Services. In addition to the three Carnet issuing entities, exporters may contact other parties including brokers and freight forwarders who can assist with the preparation of an ATA carnet; however, the carnets will be issued by the designated service providers. \r\n Exporters can obtain ATA Carnets and carnet bonds services via an online application process. \r\n All carnet applicants must be furnished with a security deposit in the form of cash or bond by USCIB or the two service providers. The deposit acts as collateral and will be drawn upon to reimburse the USCIB in the event it incurs a liability or loss in connection with the carnet or its use. Cash deposits are returned in full and bonds are terminated once the original carnet has been returned and no claims are anticipated by the USCIB. \r\n How Much Does A Carnet Cost? \r\n The value of the shipment determines carnet processing fees. \r\n How Long Does It Take To Process A Carnet? \r\n It can take two business days to process a carnet application if the application and security deposit are received by 4:00 pm ET. Applications received after 4:00 pm will be processed the following business day or will incur an expedited service fee. \r\n What If I Lose My Carnet Documents? \r\n The USCIB or its two designated service providers offer warranty coverage for lost, stolen, or destroyed carnet forms for a fee. The USCIB will issue an immediate replacement to customers with this warranty. Full terms and conditions of carnet warranties are available when submitting an application electronically, or by contacting an ATA Carnet consultant for details. \r\n Can I Sell The Goods Covered Under Carnet? \r\n Carnets are NOT recommended for goods intended for sale. Should some of the goods be sold, Carnets are subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the duties and taxes in addition to the payment of duties and taxes for the goods sold off. A USCIB Claims Handling Fee may also apply. \r\n For goods sold off ATA Carnet, a company needs to contact a local customs office to determine the most appropriate procedure. Some countries such as U.K. and Australia tightly control the sale of goods accompanied by carnets. Generally, local customs will request that the goods and ATA Carnets be brought to the local office prior to Carnet expiration so that the Carnet may be properly discharged and duties, taxes, and penalty paid. \r\n Companies are advised to obtain an itemized customs receipt noting the items sold, amount paid, and ATA Carnet number. The original ATA Carnet and a copy of the Customs receipt need to be sent to the USCIB. It is important to retain a clear copy of the Carnet for the record. \r\n If you have questions, contact USCIB Claims Administration at 212.703.5075 or azhang@uscib.org. \r\n If A Country Does Not Accept Carnets, What Are My Alternatives? \r\n For countries that do not accept carnets, companies can apply for a Temporary Importation Bond (TIB), documents which can be purchased from a customs broker at the time of entry. TIB deposits and payments are usually made in cash in the currency of the importing country. TIBs must also be posted each time a product is imported. Fees for posting TIBs vary across countries and depend on the type of product being imported. Companies should expect that it might take several months before the cash deposits are refunded. \r\n Another alternative to a carnet is the duty drawback for temporary imports, a process whereby importers register the goods at the time of entry into a foreign country by making a consumption entry and deposit the applicable duties and taxes with the importing country's customs authority. Like TIBs, the deposit and payment are usually made in cash and in the currency of the importing country. At the time of departure, the foreign customs authority will inspect and collect the appropriate paperwork for the product. Companies will receive a partial refund of the duties and taxes posted under the duty drawback in the future. \r\n Companies should contact a customs broker in the importing country to post TIBs or apply for a duty drawback. \r\n What Are My Options For Temporary Importation Under North American Free Trade Agreement? \r\n Companies that need to send temporary exports can take advantage of special provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and avoid paying duties. NAFTA requires Canada, Mexico and the United States to grant duty- free temporary admission to certain classes of goods imported from another NAFTA country. In addition, under its service provisions, the agreement provides \"tools of the trade\" arrangements that allow U. S. companies to send their service personnel, along with their tools, to a NAFTA country. The goods do not have to originate in a NAFTA country to qualify for temporary entry provisions. \r\n ATA Carnets are accepted in Canada. However, many goods are already traded duty- free between the United States and Canada, which makes carnets less important than in other countries. In addition, there are many categories of goods for which Canada permits temporary entry under a special schedule if the exporter completes a Temporary Admission Permit, and, where required, a Canada Customs Coding Form. Many temporary imports fall into one of these categories and can be imported duty-free. Temporary imports must also be classified under the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) number associated with temporary imports into Canada, under Chapter 98.

Tariffs on the remaining products have been nearly phased out. To be eligible for tariff-free treatment under the FTA, products must meet the relevant rules of origin. \r\n The FTA also provides favorable access for U.S. service suppliers and guarantees of protection to U.S. investors and U.S. copyrights, trademarks and patents registered in Chile. In addition, Chile has opened up significant government procurements to U.S. bidders. \r\n Chile's open economy and strong democratic institutions make it one of the most stable countries for doing business in the region.

Thus, those familiar with NAFTA will recognize some aspects of the Rules of Origin section of the U.S.-Australia FTA. There are, however, some important differences, which require the close attention of the U.S. exporter. If you are new to this process, review the How to Read the Rules of Origin section below prior to reviewing the U.S.-Australia FTA Rules of Origin. \r\n How To Read the Rules of Origin \r\n Rules of origin are written in terms of the Harmonized System (HS) of Tariff Classification. The HS classification system uses six to ten digit codes to identify goods. The first six digits of an HS number are harmonized among the majority of the world's countries. The last four digits are unique to each country. The vast majority of the product-specific rules of origin under the U.S.-Australia FTA use an HS classification number. The United States uses Schedule B Numbers to classify exported products from the United States and these numbers are based on the international HS system. Therefore, the first step in interpreting the \"rules\" is to obtain the appropriate code for the good in question. Note: the first two digits of an HS number are referred to as a \"chapter,\" the first four digits are called a \"heading\" (e.g., 1905), and the first six digits are called a \"subheading\" (e.g., 1905.90). \r\n A rule of origin may consist of: \r\n  A change in tariff classification \r\n A regional value-content requirement \r\n Both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement. \r\n  Note: It is necessary to refer to the rule associated with the product being exported. Regional value content can only be applied when it is allowed under a product-specific rule, and only a minority of product-specific rules of origin allow for regional value content calculations. \r\n Some Examples \r\n  An example of a rule that employs a simple tariff shift is: \r\n   \nRule of Origin: \"A change to heading 1902 through 1905 from any other chapter.\" \r\n \nProducts: Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits (HS 1905.90) \r\n \nNon-U.S. or Australian input: Flour (classified in HS chapter 11), imported from Europe. \r\n Explanation: For all products classified in HS headings 1902 through 1905, all non-U.S. or Australian inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 19 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment. These baked goods would qualify for tariff preference because the non-originating goods are classified outside of HS chapter 19. (The flour is in chapter 11). However, if these products were produced with non-originating mixes, then these products would not qualify because mixes are classified in HS chapter 19, the same chapter as baked goods. \r\n  2. An example of a rule that employs both the \"tariff shift\" and \"regional value content\" is: \r\n  \nRule of Origin: A change to subheading 9403.10 through 9403.80 from any other heading; or \r\n A change to subheading 9403.10 through 9403.80 from any other subheading, provided there is a regional value content of not less than \r\n  35 percent based on the build-up method, or \r\n 45 percent based on the build-down method \r\n  \nProduct: Wooden Furniture (HS # 9403.50) \r\n \nNon U.S. or Australian input: Parts of furniture (classified in 9403.90), imported from Asia. \r\n Explanation: Wooden furniture can qualify for preferential tariff treatment in two different ways - through a tariff shift, or a combination of a tariff shift and regional value content requirement. \r\n  Because the non-U.S. or Australian input is classified in the same heading (9403) as the final product in this case, the good does not meet the simple \"tariff shift\" in the first rule. Moving down to the second rule though, the good can meet the tariff shift because the non-originating component is from a different subheading than the final product. For the good to qualify as originating, however, it must also pass the regional value content test. \r\n Regional Value Content \r\n The Regional Value Content test allows the good to qualify using either one of two methods: \r\n  Build-down method: \r\n  Regional Value Content (RVC) = (( Adjusted Value - Value of Non-Originating Materials)/Adjusted Value)X 100 \r\n  Build-up method: \r\n  Regional Value Content (RVC) = (Originating Materials/Adjusted Value) X 100 \r\n   Using the example above then: \r\n  We will assume that the adjusted value for the piece of furniture in question is $1000.00. \r\n The value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good excludes, according to Article 5.5: \r\n    The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer \r\n Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable \r\n The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or byproducts \r\n The cost of processing incurred in the territory of a Party in the production of the non-originating materials \r\n The cost of originating materials used in the production of the non-originating material in the territory of a Party \r\n   Our assumed Value of Non-originating Materials in this case is $500.00. Plugging this into the build-down formula: \r\n  Regional Value Content (RVC) = ($1000 - $500)/$1000 X 100 = 50% \r\n  We can see that the percentage is greater than the 45% required by the rule. Therefore, the good qualifies as originating. \r\n If instead, we use the build-up formula (i.e., (value of originating materials / adjusted value) X 100): \r\n Note: Certain expense may be added (as some are able to be deducted from non-originating materials covered above) to the value of originating materials. For more information on valuing materials, refer to Article 5.4 and 5.5 of the FTA. \r\n  Regional Value Content (RVC) = $500/$1000 X 100 = 50% \r\n  The RVC is again 50% and is greater than the 35% required by the rule. With either method, the good specified in this example qualifies as originating under the U.S.-Australia FTA. \r\n Other Factors \r\n In addition to the rules of origin, it is sometimes appropriate to consider other factors found in Chapter 5 of the U.S.-Australia FTA when determining the origin of a product. \r\n De Minimis \r\n Even if a good does not meet the rule of origin requirement, if foreign components do not exceed ten percent of the adjusted value of the good, i.e., a de minimis amount, and the good meets all other applicable criteria set forth in Chapter 5 for qualifying, then the good will be considered originating. \r\n For textiles and apparel the de minimis rule requires all non-originating fibers and yarns make up less than seven percent of the total weight of the product. \r\n There are some cases where the de minimis rule does not apply. To review these exceptions, go to Article 5.2 of the Agreement. For textiles and apparel refer to Article 4.2 of the Agreement. \r\n Accumulation \r\n Goods that are produced in either the United States or Australia, or both, qualify as originating in this Agreement. Thus, inputs from Australia are included in determining whether a good exported from the United States qualifies for FTA treatment. \r\n Fungible Goods \r\n To simplify origin claims, the U.S.-Australia FTA allows exporters to consolidate fungible inputs that originate from various foreign countries and use normal accounting rules to determine their origin. Fungible goods or materials refers to goods or materials that are interchangeable for commercial purposes and whose properties are essentially identical. Their origin may be decided based upon any of the inventory methods generally recognized in the exporting country, such as averaging, last-in first-out, or first-in first-out. Physical separation of the goods is not necessary.

Exports of these goods account for 93%of total U.S. goods sales in Australia's market. The eventual elimination of all tariffs will create new export opportunities for America's manufacturers. \r\n The FTA also affords substantial benefits in a broad range of other sectors as well. Markets for services such as life insurance and express delivery will be opened; intellectual property will be better protected; American investments will be facilitated through predictable access and a stable business environment. For the first time in many sectors, American firms will be allowed to compete for Australia's government purchases on a nondiscriminatory basis. All U.S. farm exports will go duty-free to Australia, benefiting many sectors such as processed foods, fruits and vegetables, corn, and soybeans. The FTA also makes advances in e-commerce and pharmaceutical market access. A summary describing all of these benefits is available at the USTR website. \r\n By Sector \r\n With virtually all U.S. manufactured exports becoming duty-free immediately, the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimates that the manufacturing sector could sell $2 billion more per year to Australia and that U.S. national income could grow by nearly that much. \r\n U.S. exports to Australia grew 11% in 2010, with the sectors of mining, organic farming, and motorcycles growing the fastest in Australia. Overall, the principal U.S. exports to Australia in 2010 are in the sectors of machinery, vehicles; not railway, optic/medical instruments, and electrical machinery. \r\n Additional Resources \r\n  Australian Department of Foreign Affairs \u0026amp; Trade: Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement \r\n Country Data: Australia \r\n Find an Export Assistance Center \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-03","title":"The U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Australia"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"77","content":" Those familiar with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will recognize some aspects of this agreement's Rules of Origin as the U.S. Chile FTA was largely modeled upon the NAFTA. There are however some important differences, which require the close attention of the US exporter. If you are new to this process, we suggest reading the How to Read the Rules of Origin section below, prior to reviewing the U.S.-Chile FTA Rules of Origin. \r\n How To Read the Rules of Origin \r\n Rules of origin are written in terms of the Harmonized System of Tariff Classification, otherwise known as Schedule B codes. Therefore, the first step to using the \"rules\" is to obtain the appropriate code for the product in question. \r\n A rule of origin may consist of: \r\n  A change in tariff classification \r\n A regional value-content requirement \r\n Both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement \r\n  Note: It is necessary to refer to the rule associated with the product being exported. Regional value content can only be applied when it is allowed under a product-specific rule. \r\n Some Examples \r\n  An example of a rule that employs a simple tariff shift is: \r\n   \nRule of Origin: \"A change to heading 1902 through 1905 from any other chapter.\" \r\n \nProducts: Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits (HS 1905.90) \r\n \nNon-U.S. or Chilean input: Flour (classified in HS chapter 11), imported from Europe. \r\n \nExplanation: For all products classified in HS headings 1902 through 1905, all non-U.S. or Chilean inputs, must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 19 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment. These baked goods would qualify for tariff preference because the non-originating goods are classified outside of HS chapter 19. (The flour is in chapter 11). However, if these products were produced with non-originating mixes, then these products would not qualify because mixes are classified in HS chapter 19, the same chapter as baked goods. \r\n  2. An example of a rule that employs both the \"tariff shift\" and \"regional value content\" is: \r\n  \nRule of Origin: A change to subheading 9403.10 through 9403.80 from any other heading; or \r\n A change to subheading 9403.10 through 9403.80 from any other subheading, including another subheading within that group, provided there is a regional value content of not less than: \r\n  35 percent when the build-up method is used, or \r\n 45 percent when the build-down method is used \r\n  \nProduct: Wooden Furniture (HS # 9403.50) \r\n \nNon US or Chilean input: Parts of furniture (classified in 9403.90), imported from Asia. \r\n \nExplanation: Wooden furniture can qualify for preferential tariff treatment in two different ways – through a tariff shift, or a combination of a tariff shift and regional value content requirement. \r\n  Because the non-U.S. Or Chilean input is classified in the same heading (9403) as the final product in this case, the good does not make the simple \"tariff shift\" in the first rule. Moving down to the second rule though, the good can meet the tariff shift because the non-originating component is from a different subheading than the final product. For the good to qualify as originating, however, it must also pass the regional value content test. \r\n Regional Value Content \r\n The Regional Value Content test allows the good to qualify using either one of two methods. These are the builddown and build up methods. \r\n Builddown method: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) =(( Adjusted Value - Value of Non-Originating Materials)/ Adjusted Value)X 100 \r\n Buildup method: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = (Value of Originating Materials/Adjusted Value) X 100 \r\n Using the example above then: \r\n   We will assume that the adjusted value for the piece of furniture in question is $1000.00. \r\n The value of non-originating materials used in the production of the good excludes, according to Article 4.3: \r\n  The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer \r\n Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable \r\n The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or byproducts \r\n The cost of originating materials used in the production of the non-originating material in the territory of a Party \r\n   Our assumed Value of Non-originating Materials in this case is $500.00. \r\n Plugging this into the builddown formula: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = ($1000 – $500)/$1000 X 100 = 50% \r\n We can see that the percentage is greater than the 45% required by the rule. Therefore, the good qualifies as originating. \r\n If instead, we use the buildup formula: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = $500/$1000 X 100 = 50% \r\n The Regional Value Content is again 50% and is greater than the 35% required by the rule. With either method, the good specified in this example qualifies as originating under the U.S.-Chile FTA. \r\n In addition to the rules of origin, it is sometimes appropriate to consider other factors found in Chapter Four of the US Chile-FTA when determining the origin of a product.

The rules are designed to ensure that only products that have been significantly manufactured in the United States or Bahrain will enjoy preferential treatment when exported to the other country. \r\n For U.S. goods to meet FTA standards for export to Bahrain, they must meet the following requirements: \r\n  Goods must be made entirely in the United States and/or Bahrain \r\n For goods not subject to the specific rules of origin found in Annex 3-A or Annex 4-A, if any third-country materials are used, they must be “substantially transformed” by manufacturing or processing in the territory of one or both of the parties and must contain not less than 35% U.S. and/or Bahrain content. \r\n Goods covered by the specific rules of origin found in Annex 3-A or Annex 4-Amust satisfy the relevant rules found in those Annexes.\r\n  Goods must be imported into Bahrain directly from the United States. \r\n  \r\n  Substantial Transformation Requirement \r\n Few products, other than agricultural products, are made up completely of U.S. content. \r\n A product is substantially transformed when it undergoes a change in \"name, character, or use\" that is deemed \"substantial.\" \r\n Examples of a substantial transformation include: \r\n  Wood =\u0026gt; Wood table \r\n Glass sheet =\u0026gt; Car Windshield \r\n  Some examples of manufacturing that do not meet the substantial transformation qualification include: \r\n  Blank ceramic vase =\u0026gt; Hand-painted vase \r\n Unfinished wood chairs =\u0026gt; Finished wood chairs \r\n  35% U.S./Bahrain Content Requirement \r\n Goods not covered by the rules in Annex 3-A and Annex 4-A must also meet the quantitative origin requirement to qualify for preferential treatment under the FTA. Under this requirement, 35% of the appraised value of the good imported into Bahrain must be attributable to the cost or value of U.S./Bahrain origin materials and/or the direct costs of processing the product in the United States/Bahrain.  (Unlike the U.S.-Jordan FTA, a U.S. exporter may apply the full value of components imported from Bahrain, as long as the components meet the requirements specified in Article 4.1 of Chapter 4 of the FTA, toward satisfying the 35% value-content requirement.) \r\n It is important to note that the cost or value of materials incorporated in the imported good may be counted toward the 35% domestic content requirement only if such materials are produced in the United States and/or Bahrain. Materials will be considered produced in the United States and/or Bahrain if the materials are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or both of the Parties; or the materials are substantially transformed in the United States into a new and different article of commerce, which is then incorporated into the finished good. \r\n For more information about what may be included when calculating the cost or value of the materials used and the direct costs of processing operations please see Chapter 4 of the Agreement. \r\n Certain Product-Specific Rules of Origin \r\n The U.S.-Bahrain FTA also contains a limited number of product-specific requirements (edible products and textiles and apparel goods) that may be found in Annex 3-A of Chapter 3 and Annex 4-A of Chapter 4 of the Agreement.

The exact manner that such a claim will be made will be determined by the Bahrain Government. Although the U.S.-Bahrain FTA specifically obligates the importer with claiming, and supporting claims of, preferential treatment, a U.S. exporter should work with the importer to ensure that the U.S. good meets the rule of origin requirements set out in the Agreement (prior to making a claim). It is also recommended that U.S. companies maintain their own supporting records. \r\n Certifying Origin \r\n The Bahrain importer is required to submit to the customs authorities, upon request, a declaration setting forth all pertinent information concerning the growth, production, or manufacture of the good to support a claim of preferential treatment. The U.S.-Bahrain FTA establishes a minimum amount of information that may be required. Therefore, a Bahrain importer may request at a minimum the following information from a U.S. exporter: \r\n  A description of the good, quantity, invoice numbers and bills of lading \r\n A description of the operations performed in the growth, production, or manufacture of the good in the territory of one or both of the Parties and, where applicable, identification of the direct costs of processing operations \r\n A description of any materials used in the growth, production, or manufacture of the good that are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or both of the Parties, and a statement as to the value of such materials \r\n A description of the operations performed on, and a statement as to the origin and value of, any foreign materials used in the good that are claimed to have been sufficiently processed in the territory of one or both of the Parties so as to be materials produced in the territory of one or both of the Parties, or are claimed to have undergone an applicable change in tariff classification specified in Annex 3-A or Annex 4-A\n \r\n A description of the origin and value of any foreign materials used in the good that are not claimed to have been substantially transformed in the territory of one or both of the Parties, or are not claimed to have undergone an applicable change in tariff classification specified in Annex 3-A or Annex 4-A. \r\n  The Agreement states that the importing Party’s customs authority should request a declaration only when that Party has reason to question the accuracy of a deemed certification referred to in subparagraph (a) of Article 4.10, when that Party's risk assessment procedures indicate that verification of a claim is appropriate, or when the Party conducts a random verification.

It is the importer’s responsibility to declare in writing in the importation document that a good qualifies as originating. According to the Australian Customs Authority, when importing into Australia and claiming a preferential rate of customs duty for a U.S. originating good, the importer must use the preference code “U” in the preference indicator field on the import entry. \r\n The Australian importer should work with the U.S. exporter to ensure that a U.S. good meets the relevant rule of origin under the U.S.-Australia FTA prior to making a claim.  \r\n Certifying Origin \r\n The U.S. exporter may be requested by the importer or the Australian Customs Service to provide information to support a claim of preferential treatment.  The information required should confirm that the goods are: \r\n  Wholly obtained or produced entirely in the United States, such as minerals extracted here, vegetables harvested here, or live animals born and raised here, or \r\n Produced in the United States wholly from other originating materials from either Australia or the United States, or \r\n Produced in the United States partly from non-originating materials, but such non-originating materials undergo processing so that the good meets the requirements of the rules of origin in Annex 4-A to the Textiles and Apparel Chapter and for other goods, Annex 5-A General Notes and Product Specific Rules.

(Under the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement (U.S.-Chile FTA), the ultimate responsibility for the validity of the claim lies with the importer, not the exporter as under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). For more specific information on this, see Article 4.14 of the U.S.-Chile FTA.) In order to claim eligibility for a preferential duty rate, the importer must provide to National Customs Service of Chile (Chilean Customs) a written declaration in the importation document that the good is originating. The importer must also be prepared to provide Chilean Customs, upon request, with a certificate of origin (or other information demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating). \r\n Certificate of Origin \r\n In general, a certification of origin can take many forms, for instance: a statement on company letterhead, a statement on a commercial invoice, or a formal certificate of origin. While no official form is required in order to demonstrate origin under the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement, the Chilean Customs issued a list of required data elements. These data elements, as well as a sample certificate of origin, can be found at the link below. Shipments under $2,500 in value do not require a certificate of origin or other supporting information of a preferential claim unless the customs authority suspects a claim is fraudulent (see Article 4.13 of the Agreement). \r\n Sample Certificate of Origin \r\n Supporting Documentation \r\n Despite the fact that the ultimate responsibility for making the declaration lies with the importer, more often than not the information needed to support the declaration will have to be provided by the producer/exporter. The supporting information (e.g., certificate of origin) behind a claim of preferential treatment may be produced by the exporter, importer, or producer of the good. If this supporting information is not generated by the producer (i.e., the importer or exporter), it must be based upon either 1) a certificate of origin issued by the producer or 2) the exporter's or importer's knowledge that the good qualifies as originating. In other words, the importer is heavily dependent upon the assistance and cooperation of U.S. suppliers in producing accurate and well-documented declarations of origin. \r\n An importer claiming preferential treatment for a good is required to have the certificate of origin and/or other supporting documentation used in demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating under the U.S.-Chile FTA rules of origin for a period of five years from the date of importation of the good. \r\n Exporter's Obligations \r\n A producer or exporter that generates a certificate of origin should maintain for a period of at least five years after the date the certificate was issued a copy of the certificate along with all records and supporting documents related to the origin of the good, including: \r\n  Purchase, cost, value of, and payment for, the good \r\n Where appropriate, the purchase, cost, value of, and payment for, all materials, including recovered goods, used in the production of the good \r\n Where appropriate, the production of the good in the form in which it was exported \r\n  Filing A Correction (Exporter's Obligations) \r\n After an exporter/producer issues a certificate of origin (whether to the importer or Chilean Customs), it may come to the attention of one of the parties to a transaction that the basis of the claim was made on incorrect information or that the certificate of origin contains some type of error. In the case where the certificate was issued by an exporter or producer, it is the responsibility of the exporter or producer of the certificate of origin to immediately notify, in writing, every person to whom it was originally issued of any change that would affect the accuracy or validity of the certificate. While unpaid duties will have to be paid to the customs authority if a good no longer qualifies as originating, penalties may not be imposed by the customs authority on the issuer of the certificate of origin if such action is taken. \r\n Special Cases \r\n In some cases, a considerable amount of research into the inputs in the production of the goods is required in order to determine origin. Many exporters and importers believe that the only time that the declaration of origin can be provided is at the time the shipment clears customs, creating a sense of urgency in determining the origin of the goods. To obtain the reduced duty rate immediately, this is true. The importer, however, has another option. The importer may pay the non-preferential duties at the time the goods clear customs and then has up to one year from the date on which the goods were imported to apply for a refund of excess duties paid as a result of the good not being accorded preferential tariff treatment. This may happen in cases where the information required to determine that the good is originating is not available at the time of shipment. At the time of the application for refund, the importer is required to supply a written declaration of the goods' originating status, and, if requested by the customs authority, a certificate of origin or other information demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating; and other documentation relating to the importation of the good that the customs authority may require. \r\n In some situations, an exporter may find that multiple shipments of identical goods are being sent to the same Chilean importer. In these cases, it is not necessary to generate new supporting documentation (e.g., certificate of origin) for each individual shipment. The importer may maintain one such \"blanket\" certificate of origin (or other information demonstrating that a good originates) to be presented to the customs authority at the acceptance of each shipment.

Under the U.S.-Bahrain FTA, Bahrain has made broad commitments to open its services market wider than any previous U.S. FTA partner, streamline digital trade, improve intellectual property right protections, facilitate government procurement, and provide for effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws. \r\n To determine when products that qualify can enter Bahrain duty-free: \r\n   It is necessary to obtain the appropriate HS number for your product. \r\n With this number it is then possible to check the Bahrain tariff elimination schedule to find out at what rate the duties on your product will be reduced. Each line item of the U.S. and Bahrain FTA tariff schedules are assigned a letter code that indicates the staging by which the current tariff for each item is reduced and ultimately eliminated. The schedules also note the base rate of customs duty, which is used to determine the starting point and interim rate at each stage of reduction for an item. \r\n   Staging Categories \r\n The staging categories are defined in Annex 2-B of the Agreement. The codes are generally defined as follows: \r\n    \nCategory A: Goods become duty-free immediately upon the date that the FTA enters into force. \r\n \nCategory B: Duties will be eliminated in ten equal annual stages beginning on the date the Agreement enters unto force, and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year ten. \r\n \nCategory C: Goods already receiving duty-free treatment shall continue to receive duty-free treatment. \r\n The General Notes Section of Bahrain's Tariff Schedule has two additional categories, which are generally defined as follows: \r\n  \nCategory H: Duties shall remain at base rates (those rates in effect on January 1, 2003) during years one through nine. Duties will be eliminated effective January 1 of year ten. Bahrain specifically reserves the right to establish regulatory measures or apply fees or excise charges pertaining to the distribution, sale, or consumption of goods provided for in the items in Staging Category H. \r\n \nCategory I: Duties shall remain at base rates (those rates in effect on January 1, 2003) during years one through nine. Duties will be eliminated effective January 1 of year ten. Bahrain may continue to prohibit the importation of goods provided for in the items in Staging Category I. \r\n     Sample Calculations for Exports to Bahrain \r\n The following examples are expressed in terms of the Customs Tariff Schedule of Bahrain, which is similar to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), but is not exactly identical. \r\n   \nTomato Paste (HS 2002.90.10): According to the Bahrain tariff schedule, this product has been designated Staging Category A with a base rate of 5 percent. This product, if qualifying as U.S. originating, will become duty-free immediately upon the date that the FTA enters into force. \r\n \nToilet Paper (HS 4818.10.00): According to the Bahrain tariff schedule, this product has been designated Staging Category B with a base rate of 20 percent. Beginning on the date the FTA enters into force, the duty will be reduced on a yearly basis in ten equal stages. Thus, upon entry into force the duty-rate for this good will be 18 percent. The duty will continue to drop incrementally, to 16 percent in year two, 14 percent in year three, etc., until the product becomes duty-free on the first day of year ten. \r\n  ","pub_date":"2013-01-03","title":"U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement: Tariff Elimination Schedule","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Bahrain"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"90","content":" How to Declare that a Good is Originating \r\n The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement went into effect March 15, 2012, meaning from that date onwards qualifying goods cross the respective borders with zero or a reduced tariff will apply. \r\n It is the responsibility of the importer], your customer in Korea, to claim preferential treatment for qualifying goods. Under the Agreement, the ultimate responsibility for the validity of the claim lies with the importer. It is recommended that you have a conversation with your buyer to make sure that everyone is aware of the FTA benefit, who is responsible for claiming the benefit, that the product qualifies and that you can document where the product was made. \r\n The importer can claim origin to Korean customs by relying on information provided by the exporter. However, the producer or exporter or both may be asked to provide the importer with documented evidence that a good is \"originating\" under the FTA. Providing this evidence is optional.  But without this information, the exported good will not receive preferential treatment under the FTA and non-FTA tariffs will apply. \r\n If requested, the importer must provide to the Korean Customs a written or electronic declaration that the goods are U.S. originating. U.S. goods with some non-U.S. or Korea originating content can qualify for preferential treatment, and the rules for qualifying such goods are explained and analyzed elsewhere in the document on Rules of Origin. \r\n Also, if requested, the importer must also be prepared to provide Korean Customs with documentation supporting the claim of preference. \r\n Certification of Origin \r\n The certification, if requested by the buyer of Korean Customs, has no prescribed format. Certification can take different forms including a statement on the exporter's, importer's or producer's company letterhead. While no official form is required in order to demonstrate origin under the Agreement, Korean Customs has issued a list of required data elements. The certification should include: the name of certifying person; contact information; the name of the importer; exporter or producer, depending on who is providing the certification; the tariff classification number and description of the good; formation demonstrating that the good is originating; and the date of certification. There may be additional elements requested and you should check with your importer. Shipments under $1,000 in value do not require a certificate of origin or other supporting information of a preferential claim unless the customs authority suspects a claim is fraudulent. \r\n Supporting Documentation and the Importer's Obligations \r\n Typically, the information supporting the declaration is provided by the producer/exporter. An importer claiming preferential treatment is required to maintain documents supporting the claim for a period of at least five years from the date of importation of the good. \r\n Supporting Documentation and the Exporter's Obligations \r\n A U.S. producer or exporter that generates a certification of origin should maintain a copy of the certification and the records supporting that claim for a period of at least five years after the date of importation. Such records include: \r\n  Purchase, cost, value of, and payment for the exported good \r\n The purchase, cost, value of, and payment for all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the exported good \r\n The production of the good in the form in which it was exported \r\n  Filing a Correction \r\n In the event an error is detected after a certification is submitted to Korean Customs, it is the responsibility of the exporter or producer to immediately notify the importer and Korean Customs of any change that would affect the validity of the certificate. Applicable duties must be paid on goods that do not qualify as originating under the FTA. However, penalties will not be imposed on the issuer of the certification of origin if the notification of an error has been submitted. \r\n Special Cases \r\n In some cases a considerable amount of research into the components of the production of the goods is required in order to determine origin. Many exporters and importers believe that the only time the declaration of origin can be provided is at the time the shipment clears customs, creating a sense of urgency in determining the origin of the goods in order to obtain the zero or reduced duty rate immediately. \r\n However, there are additional options. \r\n  The importer may pay the non-preferential duties at the time the goods clear customs. The importer has up to one year from the date the goods were imported to apply for a refund of excess duties paid. This may happen in cases where the information required to determine that the good is originating is not available at the time of shipment.  At the time of the application for refund, the importer is required to supply a written declaration of the goods' originating status, and, if requested by the customs authority, a certification of origin or other information demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating. \r\n In cases where the exporter sends multiple shipments of the same product to the same importer, it is not necessary to generate supporting documentation for each individual shipment. The importer may maintain one such \"blanket\" certification of origin to be presented to Korean Customs at the time of each shipment. Korean Customs suggests that the \"blanket period\" not exceed a period of one year. \r\n  Using the Rules of Origin to Qualify Your Product \r\n If you have shipped to other countries with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement, you will immediately recognize how to qualify your goods under the U.S. – Korea FTA. Whether you are looking to brush up on the rules, compare the U.S. – Korea FTA with other FTAs, or are shipping for the first time to Korea, you’ll appreciate this step-by-step explanation.

Overall, the principal U.S. exports to Morocco in 2010 are in the sectors of mineral fuel and oil, aircraft and spacecraft, fats and oils, food waste, and cereals. \r\n Additional Information \r\n  U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement legal text \r\n Summary of the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement \r\n Country Data: Morocco \r\n Find an Export Assistance Center \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-04","title":"The U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement ","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":false,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Morocco"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"87","content":" The U.S. – Jordan FTA will eliminate tariffs on U.S. and Jordanian goods over a ten-year period. However, most products will become duty-free much sooner. \r\n To determine when your product can enter Jordan duty-free: \r\n  Obtain the Harmonized System (HS)/Schedule B for your product \r\n Check the Jordanian Tariff Schedules to find the rate at which the duties on your product will be reduced \r\n  The Jordanian Tariff Schedules are organized into groups by HS chapter: Chapter 1-27, Chapter 28-49, Chapter 50–69, Chapter 70-98. \r\n The FTA tariff schedules code each line item with a letter (A through M), indicating the staging by which the current tariff for each item is reduced and ultimately eliminated. Consult the tariff schedule below to determine what staging category applies to your product. \r\n Staging Categories \r\n Except as otherwise noted in the headnotes section to each tariff schedule, the codes are generally defined as follows: \r\n  \nCategory A: Duties will be eliminated in two equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year one (2001), and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year two (2002). \r\n \nCategory B: Duties will be eliminated in four equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year one (2001), and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year four (2004). \r\n \nCategory C: Duties will be eliminated in five equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year one (2001), and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year five (2005). \r\n \nCategory D: Duties will be eliminated in ten equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year one (2001), and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year ten (2010). \r\n \nCategory E: Duties will be eliminated in accordance with existing WTO duty-elimination commitments (WTO Schedule XX for the United States, and WTO Schedule CXLVII for Jordan). \r\n \nCategory I: Duties will be eliminated in eight equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year one (2001), and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year eight (2008). \r\n \nCategory J: Duties will be reduced by one percentage point annually beginning upon January 1 of year one (2001), for the first five years of implementation (2005). Thereafter, the rates of duty will be eliminated in five equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year six, and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year ten (2010). \r\n \nCategory K: Duties will be reduced by one percentage point annually beginning upon January 1 of year one (2001), for the first two years of implementation (2002), and remain unchanged for the next three years (2005). Thereafter, the rates of duty will be eliminated in five equal annual stages beginning on January 1 of year six, and shall be duty-free effective January 1 of year ten (2010). \r\n \nCategory L: Duties will remain at base rates for the first three years of implementation (2003). Beginning on January 1 of year four (2004), rates will be reduced by five percent; by ten percent in year five (2005); by ten percent in year six (2006). Thereafter, the rates of duty reduced in equal annual stages, and the duty on such goods shall be 44.5 percent of the base rate effective on January 1 of year ten (2010). \r\n \nCategory M: Duties will remain at base rates for the first four years of implementation (2004).

The FTA eliminated duties on manufactured goods as of January 1, 1995. It also allowed the United States and Israel to protect sensitive agricultural sub-sectors with non-tariff barriers, including import bans, quotas, and fees. In 2004, the United States and Israel signed an agricultural agreement. \r\n The U.S. – Israel FTA is outdated by today's standards because it has detailed obligations only on merchandise trade while the more recent FTAs include detailed obligations on agriculture, services, investment, intellectual property protection, standards, transparency, and rule of law. \r\n Before and After the U.S. – Israel FTA \r\n  Overall Trade in Goods between the United States and Israel grew from $3.5 billion in 1985 to $26.5 billion in 2005, an increase of 657%. \r\n U.S. exports to Israel grew from $2.58 billion in 1985 to $9.7 billion in 2005, an increase of 288%. \r\n U.S. imports from Israel grew from $2.20 billion in 1985 to $16.8 billion in 2005, an increase of 663%. \r\n In 1985, Israel was our 30th largest trading partner (exports and imports combined) and now ranks 18th. \r\n  Benefits of the FTA \r\n Investment: U.S. investment in Israel in 2004 data reached $6.7 billion, representing 49% of all foreign direct investment in Israel. U.S. companies have invested primarily in the Israeli communications, software, and life sciences sectors. \r\n Services: The FTA includes a non-binding statement of intent to eliminate barriers to trade in services such as tourism, communications, banking, insurance, management consulting, accounting, law, computer services, and advertising. \r\n Government Procurement: The FTA includes an agreement to eliminate all restrictions on government procurement, and calls on Israel to relax its offsets requirements for government agencies other than the Israeli Ministry of Defense. However, American companies are concerned about government procurement process, including the lack of transparency in the evaluation of tenders, lengthy tender procedures stemming from a lack of preparation, and the use of negotiated agreements or directed contracts rather than public tenders. \r\n IPR: The FTA reaffirms obligations under bilateral and multilateral agreements relating to intellectual property rights.  However, Israel was elevated to the Priority Watch List (PWL) in the USTR's 2005 Special 301 due to continuing concerns regarding its policies on data protection for proprietary test data.

The FTA, therefore, does not include an investment chapter.  U.S. FDI into Jordan in 2004 was $54 million. \r\n Services: The FTA opened up trade in services, giving American service providers excellent opportunities in Jordan’s financial, education, audio-visual, courier, and other services. \r\n Government Procurement: Jordan applied to accede to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement on July 12, 2000. The FTA notes that Jordan and the United States will enter into negotiations with regard to Jordan accession to the GPA.  Jordan has not yet completed its accession to the GPA. \r\n IPR: In the FTA, IPR commitments constitute 29 paragraphs, or one-quarter of the entire document. However, although Jordan has revised its IPR laws and had been a leader on IPR protection in the region, the laws and regulations underpinning IPR protection lack coherence, and lead to sub-optimal and ad-hoc solutions to commonly recognized IPR protection problems. Jordan was accorded a transition period until December 2004 before being required to fully implement FTA IPR provisions, but has not yet done so.

It is generally reserved for basic products such as those harvested, mined, or fished in the signatory territories, although can include a manufactured good with no non-U.S. and/or non-Peruvian inputs. Very few manufactured goods will qualify under this criterion. \r\n It is produced entirely in the United States and/or Peru using non-originating material (i.e., materials from outside the countries listed above) that satisfy the rule of origin specified in Annex 4.1 of the Agreement. \r\n It is produced entirely in the United States and/or Peru exclusively from materials that are already originating (by meeting the qualifications described above). \r\n  How To Read the Rules of Origin \r\n The product-specific rules of origin are written in terms of the Harmonized System (HS) of Tariff Classification. The HS classification system uses six to ten digit codes to identify goods. The first six digits of an HS number are harmonized among the majority of the world's countries. The last four digits are unique to each country. The vast majority of the product-specific rules of origin under the U.S.-Peru TPA use an HS classification number. The United States uses Schedule B Codes to classify exported products from the United States and these numbers are based on the international HS system. Therefore, the first step in interpreting the \"rules\" is to obtain the appropriate code for the good in question. (Note: the first two digits of an HS number are referred to as a \"chapter,\" the first four digits are called a \"heading\" (e.g., 1905), and the first six digits are called a \"subheading\" (e.g., 1905.90).) \r\n A rule of origin may consist of: \r\n  A required change in tariff classification (also called a tariff shift) \r\n A regional value-content (RVC) requirement \r\n Or both, a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement \r\n  Note: It is necessary to refer to the rule associated with the product being exported. Regional value content can be applied only when it is allowed under a product-specific rule. \r\n Some Examples \r\n An example of a rule that employs a simple tariff shift is: \r\n  Rule of Origin: \"A change to headings 19.02 through 19.05 from any other chapter.\" \r\n Products: Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits (HS 1905.90 \r\n Non-U.S./Peruvian input: Flour (classified in HS chapter 11), imported from Europe (all other inputs are of U.S. origin) \r\n  Explanation: For all final goods classified under HS headings 19.05, all non-U.S. or non-Peruvian inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 19 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment. In this example, these baked goods would qualify for preferential treatment because the only non-originating input is classified outside of HS chapter 19. In other words, the good qualifies as originating because the imported flour (i.e., the non-originating input in this example) classified under chapter 11 (HS #11.01) shifted tariff numbers from 11.01 to 19.05 when incorporated into the finished good. However, if these products were produced with non-originating mixes (i.e., not manufactured in the United States or Peru), which are classified in HS chapter 19, then these products would not qualify because a tariff shift at the chapter level did not occur as prescribed under this rule of origin. \r\n Another example of a rule that employs both the \"tariff shift\" and \"regional value content\" is: \r\n  Rule of Origin: \"A change to heading 95.06 through 95.08 from any other chapter; or a change to subheading 9506.31 from subheading 9506.39, provided there is a regional value content of not less than: \r\n    35 percent when the build-up method is used \r\n 45 percent when the build-down method is used\" \r\n     Product: Golf Clubs (HS #9506.31) \r\n Non-U.S./Peruvian input: Parts of golf clubs (classified in 9506.39), imported from Asia \r\n   Explanation: Golf clubs can qualify for preferential tariff treatment in two different ways - through a tariff shift, or, a combination of a tariff shift and regional value content requirement. \r\n For all products classified in HS headings 95.06 through 95.08, all non-U.S. or non-Peruvian inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 95 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment under the tariff shift rule alone. In this example, the golf club parts used to manufacture the golf clubs were imported from Asia and are classified within HS chapter 95 (i.e., HS #9506.39); thus the good does not meet the simple \"tariff shift\" requirement in the first rule. Moving down to the second part of the rule, the good can still qualify as originating as long as it passes the regional value content test. \r\n Regional Value Content \r\n The regional value content (RVC) test allows the good to qualify using either one of two methods. These are the build-down and build-up methods. \r\n Build-down method: \r\n RVC = ((Adjusted Value of the golf clubs -- Adjusted value of Non-Originating Materials) / Adjusted Value of the golf clubs) X 100 \r\n Build-up method: \r\n RVC = (Value of Originating Materials/Adjusted Value of the golf clubs) X 100 \r\n Using the example above then: \r\n We will assume that the adjusted value of golf clubs is $500.00. \r\n Note: Adjusted value is the invoice value (determined in accordance with Articles 1 through 8, Article 15 and corresponding interpretative notes of the Customs Valuation Agreement), adjusted if necessary to exclude any costs, charges, or expenses incurred for transportation, insurance, and related services incident to the international shipment of the merchandise from the country of exportation to the place of importation. \r\n For non-originating materials used in the production of a good, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of that material in accordance with Article 4.4: \r\n  The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material within a Party's territory or between territories of two or more Parties to the location of the producer \r\n Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable \r\n The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product \r\n The cost of originating materials used in the production of the non-originating material in the territory of a Party \r\n  We will also assume that the value of non-originating materials in this case is $250.00. Plugging this into the build-down formula: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = ($500 - $250)/$500 X 100 = 50% \r\n Therefore, the good qualifies because the resultant percentage is greater than the 45% required by the rule. \r\n If instead, we use the build-up formula (i.e., (value of originating materials / adjusted value) X 100): \r\n Note: Certain expense may be added (as some are able to be deducted from non-originating materials as covered above) to the value of originating materials. For more information on valuing materials, refer to Article 4.3 and 4.4 of the TPA. \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = $250/$500 X 100 = 50% \r\n The RVC is again 50% and is greater than the 35% required by the rule. With either method, the good specified in this example qualifies as originating under the U.S.-Peru TPA. \r\n Note: the required percentage of RVC content may vary from 20% to 65%, so it is important that you review the specific requirements stated in Annex 4.1 for your good. \r\n Other Factors \r\n A thorough reading of Chapter Four of the U.S.-Peru TPA is necessary for anyone attempting to determine the origin of a product, and thus, whether it is eligible for preferential duty treatment. However, below are some of the factors, beyond the product-specific rules of origin, that may be considered in making a determination of origin. \r\n De Minimis Rule \r\n All non-originating materials used in the production of the finished good that do not undergo a change in tariff classification are considered originating if the value of all those non-originating materials does not exceed ten percent of the adjusted value of the good, i.e., the de minimis amount. This is provided that the good meets all other applicable qualification criteria set forth in Chapter 4. The de minimis rule does not apply when using the \"build-down\" method to calculate the RVC. The value of all non-originating materials used in the production of a good must be included in the calculation. \r\n For textiles and apparel, please refer to Article 3.3.8 and Annex 3-A of the U.S.-Peru TPA for the relevant de minimis rule. \r\n There are some cases where the de minimis rule does not apply. To review these exceptions, go to Annex 4.6 of the U.S.-Peru TPA. For textiles and apparel refer to Article 3.3.8. \r\n Accumulation \r\n Originating goods or materials of one or more of the Parties to the Agreement that are incorporated into a good in the territory of another Party are considered originating materials of the Party where the incorporation takes place. \r\n Reminder: A good is originating when the good is produced in the United States and/or Peru, provided that the good qualifies under the rules, as discussed above, of the TPA. \r\n Fungible Goods and Materials \r\n \"Fungible goods or materials\" refers to goods or materials that are interchangeable for commercial purposes and whose properties are essentially identical. If a company has originating and non-originating fungible goods in inventory, the U.S.-Peru TPA allows the company to treat the fungible good or material as originating where the importer, exporter, or producer has either physically segregated (originating from the non-originating) the fungible good or material or used any inventory management system to segregate that is recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or is otherwise accepted by the party where the production is performed. Examples of inventory methods include: averaging, last-in first-out (LIFO), or first-in first-out (FIFO). Please note that physical separation of the goods is not necessary, but may be used for each fungible good or material. \r\n Indirect Materials \r\n Indirect materials are considered to be originating materials regardless of where they are produced. An indirect material is defined as a good used in the production, testing, or inspection of a good, but not physically incorporated into the good, or a good used in the maintenance of buildings or the operation of equipment associated with the production of a good, including: \r\n  Fuel and energy \r\n Tools, dies, and molds \r\n Spare parts, and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings \r\n Lubricants, greases, compounding materials, and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings \r\n Gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment, and supplies \r\n Equipment, devices, and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good \r\n Catalysts and solvents \r\n Any other goods that are not incorporated into the good but whose use in the production of the good can reasonably be demonstrated to be a part of that production \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-05","title":"U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Rules of Origin","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Peru"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"95","content":" Reports and Statistics \r\n Commentary: The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a comprehensive trade agreement that improves virtually all aspects of doing business between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Upon NAFTA's entry into force on January 1, 1994, Mexico immediately eliminated tariffs on nearly 50% of all industrial goods imported from the United States and removed many non-tariff barriers. Virtually all tariffs on industrial goods were eliminated by 2003 and tariffs on U.S. exports of certain agricultural products to Mexico will be phased out on January 1, 2008. With the exception of tariff rate quotas on certain supply-managed agricultural products, all Canada-U.S. trade has been duty free since 1998. Canada and Mexico are the first and second largest export markets for U.S. goods. \r\n Before and After NAFTA: \r\n  \nOverall Trade in Goods among the United States, Canada and Mexico has grown from $297 billion in 1993 to $883 billion in 2006, an increase of 198%. \r\n \nU.S. goods exports to Canada and Mexico grew from $142 billion in 1993 to $364.6 billion in 2006, an increase of 157%. \r\n \nU.S. goods imports from Canada and Mexico grew from $151 billion in 1993 to $500.7 billion in 2006, an increase of 231%. \r\n \nU.S. services exports to Canada and Mexico have increased by 125 percent since 1993, reaching $61.7 billion in 2006 (preliminary estimate) and exceeding services imports from these two countries by $23.4 billion. \r\n \nU.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Canada and Mexico has increased by 289 percent since 1993, reaching $331.2 billion in 2006 (latest data available) and exceeding Canadian and Mexican FDI in the United States (stock) by $166.1 billion. \r\n  Benefits of NAFTA \r\n Investment: With limited exceptions, NAFTA requires U.S. investors to be treated in Mexico and Canada as well as those countries treat their own investors or investors of any other country in the establishment, acquisition, and operation of investments. NAFTA also guarantees investors the right to receive fair market value for property in the event of an expropriation. The protections of NAFTA's Investment Chapter are backed by a transparent, binding international arbitration mechanism, under which investors may, at their own initiative, bring claims against a NAFTA government for an alleged breach of the chapter. The NAFTA Parties have agreed to make public their submissions in investor-state disputes, and to make arbitral hearings open to the public. Tribunals are also authorized to accept amicussubmissions from non-disputing parties. \r\n Services: NAFTA establishes a solid framework for trade in services through the elimination of barriers in nearly all service sectors and enhancement of regulatory transparency. U.S. firms have been well positioned to take advantage of NAFTA's new market access opportunities—services exports have more than doubled under NAFTA and greatly exceed services imports. With service industries often highly regulated, regulatory transparency is essential. Under NAFTA, regulatory authorities are to use open and transparent administrative procedures, consult with interested parties, and publish all regulations. \r\n Government Procurement: The government procurement provisions of NAFTA apply to the procurement of goods, services, and construction services. U.S. suppliers are granted nondiscriminatory rights to bid on contracts to supply most Canadian and Mexican central government entities. This increases opportunities for U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico in such sectors as construction, environmental and computer software and design services, oil and gas field equipment and services, heavy electrical equipment, communications and computer systems, electronic, pharmaceutical products, and medical equipment. \r\n IPR: NAFTA recognized early the importance of intellectual property protection and enforcement within the context of international trade agreements, having been signed nearly two years before the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). NAFTA provides for the protection and enforcement of a broad range of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and test data.

In trade agreements, countries commit to lowering tariff rates over time to zero. The FTA Tariff Data Tool is a database with all of the rates the United States' Free Trade Agreement (FTA) or Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) partners have committed to implementing and maintaining. Additionally, the database includes the tariff rates for Panama, although this trade agreement has not yet been implemented. \r\n To use the FTA Tariff Tool will help you find a few key pieces of information: \r\n  \nWhat is your product's HS Code? You need to know your product's HS code. The HS code can be a 6, 8 or 10 digit number used for a category of products. Unfortunately, the HS code terminology can be somewhat arcane. For example, a computer is referred to as an automated data processing machine in HS code terminology. However, the Census Bureau has developed a cross-reference of everyday terms to HS terminology, and they provide phone support if the database does not work. \r\n \nDoes your product meet the rule of origin? Under FTAs or TPAs, tariffs are eventually eliminated for almost all products that meet the agreement’s rule of origin. A rule of origin specifies what minimum characteristics a product must have in order to take advantage of the agreement's tariff reductions and related provisions. \r\n  With this information, you can use the FTA Tariff Tool to look up the tariff rate for your product today, as well as identify when in the future the tariff rate will go down further or be eliminated altogether. Additionally, the database includes key trade statistics, such as state-by-state export values to each of our FTA partners. Ultimately, this information can help you calculate appropriate pricing for your product, identify new markets, and take full advantage of the benefits of U.S. trade agreements. \r\n Please note: The FTA Tariff Tool only displays the preferential tariff rates negotiated under the U.S. trade agreements. In some instances, FTA partner countries may have unilaterally reduced their most-favored nation (MFN) tariff rate below the FTA rate. In these instances, U.S. exports would receive the MFN rate and not receive preferential treatment into that market. Additionally, the FTA Tariff Tool does not account for changes to the tariff nomenclature since the trade agreements were concluded. \r\n Additional limitations to the FTA Tariff Tool are that it covers textiles, apparel, and industrial goods, but not agricultural goods; it only includes trading partners with which the U.S. has a trade agreement; and product descriptions for tariff schedules not published in English are in a foreign language, such as Spanish or French. \r\n \r\n Download full video .mp4 (21MB) \r\n \r\n UPDATE (July 16, 2012): The FTA Tariff Tool now includes textiles and apparel products classified within Chapters 39, 42, 50-65, 70, and 94 of the Harmonized System.

The rules are listed in HTSUS General Note 12(t) by HS code heading or subheading and may require a tariff shift which means that the foreign input must have a different heading or subheading than the exported product. Rules of origin may also require that exported products with foreign inputs contain at least a certain amount of value-added from the U.S. or other NAFTA countries. \r\n This video provides further explanation of NAFTA Rules of Origin. \r\n Interpreting NAFTA Rules of Origin \r\n A rule of origin might contain: \r\n  A change in tariff classification \r\n A regional value-content requirement \r\n Both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement. \r\n  Note: It is necessary to refer to the rule associated with the product being exported. Regional value content can only be applied when it is allowed under a product-specific rule. \r\n Example of a rule of origin \r\n Please note that within the rules of origin chapter refers to the first two (2) digits of the HS code, heading refers to the first four (4) digits of the HS code, and subheading refers to the first (6) digits of the HS code. \r\n Rule of Origin: \"A change to heading 1902 through 1905 from any other chapter.\" \r\n Products: Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits (HS 1905.90) \r\n Non-NAFTA input: Flour (classified in HS chapter 11), imported from Europe. \r\n Explanation: For all products classified in HS headings 1902 through 1905, all non-NAFTA inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 19 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment. These baked goods would qualify for tariff preference because the non-originating goods are classified outside of HS chapter 19. (The flour is in chapter 11). However, if these products were produced with non-originating mixes, then these products would not qualify because mixes are classified in HS chapter 19, the same chapter as baked goods. \r\n Other Factors: A thorough reading of Chapter Four of the NAFTA is necessary for anyone attempting to determine the origin of a product's eligibility for preferential duty rates. However, to improve understanding of these subjects, a brief discussion appears below of some of the factors, beyond the product-specific rules of origin that may be considered in determination of origin. \r\n De Minimis Rule: The de minimis rule provides an additional possibility of qualifying as originating for a good that cannot meet the required \"tariff shift.\" Despite not undergoing the specified tariff shift, a good may still be originating if the value of the non-originating materials that do not undergo the tariff classification do not exceed 7% of the adjusted value of the good. The value of these non-originating materials must also be included in the \"value of non-originating materials\" for any applicable regional value content requirement and the good must meet all other applicable requirements. Exceptions do exist to the application of the de minimis rule and they can be found in Article 405 of the NAFTA. \r\n Fungible Goods and Materials: Fungible goods and materials refers to goods or materials that are interchangeable for commercial purposes and whose properties are essentially identical. According to the Article 406 of the NAFTA, where fungible goods are handled together and commingled such that it is impossible to determine which are originating and which are not, their origin may be decided based upon any of the inventory methods recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Physical separation of the goods is not necessary. \r\n If you are not a manufacturer: \r\n  Contact the manufacturer and request a copy of a NAFTA Certificate of Origin or a Producer's Affidavit written on company letterhead stating that the product (include the HS number and description) originates in the United States and qualifies for NAFTA. \r\n Using the NAFTA Certificate of Origin or Producer's Affidavit from the manufacturer then fill out a new Certificate of Origin using the information provided by the manufacturer and keep the manufacturer's Certificate of Origin on file. \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-05","title":"North American Free Trade Agreement Rules of Origin","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["NAFTA"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Canada","Mexico"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"113","content":" As a result of the U.S. FTA with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (CAFTA-DR), 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods exports to the CAFTA-DR countries are no longer subject to tariffs.

Thus, those familiar with NAFTA will recognize some aspects of the Rules of Origin section of the U.S.-Singapore FTA. There are, however, some important differences, which require the close attention of the US exporter. \r\n How To Read the Rules of Origin \r\n Rules of origin are written in terms of the Harmonized System (HS) of Tariff Classification. The HS classification system uses six to ten digit codes to identify goods. The first six digits of an HS number are harmonized among the majority of the world's countries. The last four digits are unique to each country. The vast majority of the product-specific rules of origin under the U.S.-Singapore FTA use the HS classification number. The United States uses Schedule B Numbers to classify exported products from the United States and these numbers are based on the international HS system. Therefore, the first step in interpreting the \"rules\" is to obtain the appropriate code for the good in question. Note: the first two digits of an HS number are referred to as a \"chapter,\" the first four digits are called a \"heading\" (e.g., 1905), and the first six digits are called a \"subheading\" (e.g., 1905.90). \r\n A rule of origin may consist of: \r\n  A change in tariff classification, i.e., tariff shift \r\n A regional value-content requirement \r\n Or both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement. \r\n  Note: It is necessary to refer to the rule associated with the product being exported. Regional value content can only be applied when it is allowed under a product-specific rule. \r\n Example of a Simple Tariff Shift Rule \r\n Rule of Origin: \"Change to heading 1905 from any other chapter.\" \r\n Products: \r\n  Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits (HS 1905.90) \r\n Non-U.S. or Singapore input: Flour (classified in HS chapter 11), imported from Europe. \r\n  Explanation: For all products classified in HS headings 1905, all non-U.S. or Singapore inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 19 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment. These baked goods would qualify for tariff preference because the non-originating goods are classified outside of HS chapter 19. (The flour is in chapter 11). \r\n However, if these products were produced with non-originating mixes, then these products would not qualify because mixes are classified in HS chapter 19, the same chapter as baked goods.

U.S. agricultural goods face an average tariff of 15%, with some tariffs as high as 260%. \r\n Over 87% of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial products to Panama will become duty-free immediately upon entry into force of the U.S.-Panama TPA, with remaining tariffs phased out over ten years. U.S. products that will gain immediate duty-free access include information technology equipment, agricultural and construction equipment, aircraft and parts, medical and scientific equipment, environmental products, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, and agro-chemicals. U.S. agricultural exports will also benefit. Panama will immediately eliminate duties on high-quality beef, frozen turkeys, soybeans, soybean meal, crude soybean and corn oil, almost all fruit and fruit products, wheat, peanuts, whey, cotton, and many processed products. \r\n The U.S‐Panama TPA will also ensure that U.S. firms have an opportunity to participate on a competitive basis in the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project. Panama’s strategic location as a major shipping route and the massive project underway to expand the capacity of the Canal enhances the importance of the U.S.‐Panama TPA. In addition to the Panama Canal expansion project, the Government of Panama has identified almost $10 billion in other significant infrastructure projects. Construction equipment and infrastructure machinery used in such projects accounted for $280 million in U.S. exports to Panama in 2010. Tariffs for this sector average 5% with almost all being eliminated upon entry into force of the U.S.-Panama TPA. \r\n On October 22, 2012, the U.S. and Panama announced that the Trade Promotion Agreement will enter into force on October 31, 2012. The U.S. and Panama have completed a thorough review of our respective laws and regulations related to the TPA to ensure that U.S. exporters can take advantage of new opportunities in the Panamanian market. \r\n For additional information on how the Panama TPA will benefit U.S. businesses, farmers, and workers, visit: the International Trade Administration's U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement section which features industry and state opportunity reports. \r\n Additional Information \r\n  U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement legal text \r\n U.S. Commercial Office in Panama \r\n Find an Export Assistance Center \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-05","title":"The U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Panama"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"98","content":" Origin rules are used to determine in which country an imported product is manufactured and whether it qualifies for preferential treatment. The U.S. Oman FTA rules of origin are designed to ensure that only products that wholly originate in, or have undergone significant processing in, the United States or Oman will enjoy preferential tariff treatment. For U.S. goods to be eligible for preferential treatment when exported to Oman, they must meet the following requirements: \r\n  Goods must be made entirely in the United States and/or Oman, and be either:  Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States or Oman, or \r\n If any third-country materials are used -- for goods not subject to the specific rules of origin found in Annex 3-A (textile and apparel products) or Annex 4-A (certain edible products) -- these materials must be \"substantially transformed\" by manufacturing or processing into a new or different article of commerce in the territory of one or both of the FTA Parties and must contain not less than 35% U.S. and/or Oman content. Goods covered by the specific rules of origin found in Annex 3-A or Annex 4-A must satisfy the relevant rules found in those Annexes. These rules generally require that the goods undergo a specified change in tariff heading. \r\n  \r\n Goods must be imported into Oman directly from the United States. \r\n  Wholly the Growth, Product or Manufacture Requirement \r\n Relatively few products, other than agricultural, fishery, and mining products, are wholly obtained in a single country. Examples of agricultural goods wholly obtained in the United States include animals that are born and raised or hunted in the United States, products obtained from live animals in the United States (e.g., eggs), or plant products harvested in the United States. Other wholly obtained products include mineral products that are mined in the United States or scrap and waste from manufacturing or processing that is fit only for recovery of raw materials. Very few U.S. manufactured goods fall into the wholly obtained category. \r\n Substantial Transformation Requirement \r\n U.S. goods exported to Oman must be manufactured entirely in the United States. If any foreign materials are used to manufacture a good in the United States, those materials must undergo a substantial transformation during the production process. Except for goods covered by the rules in Annex 3-A and Annex 4-A (as noted above), any foreign input (except goods of Omani origin) used in the manufacture of a good must undergo a substantial transformation that has given it a new \"name, character, or use.\" \r\n Examples of a substantial transformation include: \r\n Wood =\u0026gt; Wood table \r\n Glass sheet =\u0026gt; Car Windshield \r\n Some examples of manufacturing that do not meet the substantial transformation qualification include: \r\n  Blank ceramic vase =\u0026gt; Hand-painted vase \r\n Unfinished wood chairs =\u0026gt; Finished wood chairs \r\n  35% U.S./Oman Content Requirement \r\n Goods not covered by the rules in Annex 3-A and Annex 4-A must also meet the thirty-five percent origin requirement to qualify for preferential treatment under the FTA. Under this requirement, 35% of the appraised value of the good imported into Oman must be attributable to the cost or value of materials of U.S. and/or Omani origin and/or the direct costs of processing the product in the United States and/or Oman. (Unlike the U.S.-Jordan FTA, a U.S. exporter may apply the full value of components imported from Oman, as long as the components themselves originate, toward satisfying the 35% value-content requirement.) \r\n It is important to note that the cost or value of materials incorporated in the imported good may be counted toward the 35% domestic content requirement only if such materials are produced in the United States and/or Oman. Materials will be considered produced in the United States and/or Oman if the materials are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or both of the Parties; or the materials are substantially transformed in the United States into a new and different article of commerce, which is then incorporated into the finished good. \r\n For more information about what may be included when calculating the cost or value of the materials used and the direct costs of processing operations please see Chapter 4 of the Agreement. \r\n Certain Product-Specific Rules of Origin \r\n The U.S.-Bahrain FTA also contains a limited number of product-specific requirements (certain edible products as well as textile and apparel goods) that may be found in Annex 3-A of Chapter 3 and Annex 4-A of Chapter 4 of the Agreement.

This treatment should make it easier to export your product to or offer your service in the FTA country's market. It may also give your product or service a competitive advantage versus products from other countries. \r\n What is an FTA negotiated by the United States? \r\n An FTA is an agreement between two or more countries where the countries agree on certain behaviors that affect trade in goods and services, and protections for investors and intellectual property rights, among other topics. For the United States, the main goal of trade agreements is to reduce barriers to U.S. exports, and protect U.S. interests and enhance the rule of law in the FTA partner country. The reduction of trade barriers and the creation of a more stable and transparent trading and investment environment make it easier and cheaper for U.S. companies to export their products and services to trading partner markets. Forty-one percent of U.S. goods exports went to FTA partner countries in 2010, with exports to those countries growing at a faster rate than exports to the rest of the world from 2009 to 2010, 23% vs. 20%. \r\n FTAs usually build off of the agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization (WTO). For example, in the WTO, each country agrees to issue, at the request of the importer or exporter, binding advance determinations on where a product will be viewed as coming from, since many products are made up of parts from multiple countries. Under an FTA, importers and exporters can obtain determinations for a broader set of issues, including finding what tariff line the product will be classified under, and value that will use to calculate the tariff. \r\n Other countries also negotiate FTAs and the behaviors covered may not be the same as those negotiated by the United States. \r\n What types of behaviors are addressed in a U.S. FTA? \r\n U.S. FTAs typically address a wide variety of government activity. One example is the eventual elimination of tariffs charged on all products coming from the other country, if the product meets the rules of origin spelled out in the agreement. For example, a country that normally charges a tariff of 5% of the value of the incoming product will eliminate that tariff for products they can certify come from the United States. The rules of origin can make using the FTA negotiated tariffs a bit more complicated, but help to ensure that U.S. exports, rather than exports from other countries, receive the benefits of the agreement. \r\n Some other types of commitments frequently found in FTAs include: \r\n  the right for a U.S. company to bid on certain government procurements in the FTA partner country \r\n the right for a U.S. investors to get adequate compensation if its investment in the FTA partner country is taken by the government (e.g., expropriated) \r\n the right for U.S. service suppliers to supply their services in the FTA partner country \r\n protection and enforcement of American-owned intellectual property rights in the FTA partner country \r\n the right for U.S. exporters to participate in the development of product standards in the FTA partner country. \r\n  With which countries does the United States have an FTA? \r\n The United States has 12 FTAs in force with 18 countries. In addition, the United States has negotiated an FTA with Panama, but this agreement has not yet entered into force. The United States is also in the process of negotiating a regional FTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. \r\n U.S. FTA Partner Countries \r\n  Australia \r\n Bahrain \r\n Chile \r\n Colombia \r\n \nDR-CAFTA: Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, \u0026amp; Nicaragua \r\n Israel \r\n Jordan \r\n Korea \r\n Morocco \r\n \nNAFTA: Canada \u0026amp; Mexico \r\n Oman \r\n Panama \r\n Peru \r\n Singapore \r\n  How can U.S. companies identify tariffs on exports to FTA partner countries? \r\n The FTA Tariff Tool can help you determine the tariff, or tax at the border, that certain foreign countries will collect when a U.S. exported product enters the country. You can look up the tariff rate for a given product today, as well as identify when in the future the tariff rate will go down further or be eliminated altogether.

Although the Peruvian importer has the responsibility of making a claim for preferential treatment, it is important that the U.S. producer, U.S. exporter (if not the producer), and Peruvian importer work closely and share information to ensure that the originating goods receive the preferential tariff treatment to which they are entitled. See the Rules of Origin for information on how to determine whether your goods meet the rule of origin requirements under the Agreement. \r\n Demonstrating Eligibility for Preferential Treatment \r\n A Peruvian importer is responsible for making a claim for preferential tariff treatment on goods exported from the United States under the Agreement. A claim for preferential tariff treatment can be made through \r\n  A written or electronic certification issued by the importer, exporter or producer, or \r\n Based on the knowledge of the importer that the good is an originating good. \r\n  Peru has delayed its implementation of claims for preferential tariff treatment based on electronic certifications and importer knowledge for 3 years from the date of entry into force of the Agreement, so for this period of time a claim for preferential tariff treatment must be made through a written certification issued by the importer, exporter or producer. When a certification is used, it need not be made in a prescribed format, but it must include the following information: \r\n  The name of the certifying person, including, as necessary, contact or other identifying information \r\n Tariff classification under the Harmonized System and a description of the good \r\n Information demonstrating that the good is originating \r\n Date of the certification \r\n In the case of blanket period certification issued as set out in Article 4.15 of Chapter 4 of the Agreement, the period that the certification covers. \r\n  When requested by the Peruvian customs authorities, the importer must be prepared to provide a copy of the certification. Note that claiming preferential treatment under this and any other free trade agreement is voluntary and it is at the discretion of the U.S. producer or U.S. exporter whether to support such a claim. \r\n Supporting Documentation \r\n Exporter's Requirements \r\n An exporter or producer that issues a certification which serves as the basis of the importer’s claim for preferential tariff treatment, is required to maintain for five years from the date the certification was issued, all records demonstrating that the good qualified for preferential tariff treatment. Records to be maintained are those concerning: \r\n  The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, the exported good \r\n The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the exported good \r\n The production of the good in the form in which it was exported \r\n  Importer's Requirements \r\n The U.S.-Peru TPA places the burden of substantiating the validity of the claim for preferential tariff treatment on the importer. An importer making a claim for preferential treatment for a good must maintain, for a minimum of five years from the date the importation is made, all records necessary to demonstrate the good qualified for preferential treatment. \r\n Filing a Correction \r\n An exporter or producer that realizes that it has provided a certification that contains or is based on inaccurate information is obligated to promptly notify in writing every person to whom the exporter or producer provided the certification of any change to the certification that could affect the validity and accuracy of the certification. If an importer made a claim for preferential tariff treatment based on an inaccurate certification issued by the exporter or producer, the importer may be liable for any applicable unpaid customs duties. \r\n An importer that makes an invalid claim for preferential tariff treatment cannot be penalized if the importer did not engage in negligence, gross negligence, or fraud, and if the importer promptly and voluntarily corrects the claim and pays any customs duties owed. \r\n A Claim for Preferential Tariff Treatment May be Made Up to One Year After Importation \r\n An importer may make a retroactive claim for preferential tariff treatment for a good that was originating when imported, but for which the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation. A retroactive claim must be made no later than one year after the date of importation. The importer can also apply for a refund of any excess duties paid. \r\n To do so the importer must provide: \r\n  Written declaration stating the good was originating at the time of importation \r\n A written or electronic certification, if a certification forms the basis for the claim, or other information demonstrating the good is originating \r\n Any other documentation the importing country may require \r\n  Blanket Certifications \r\n Where an importer, exporter and producer make multiple shipments of identical goods within a 12 month period, the importer can use a blanket certification which covers all importations of those goods as the basis for its claims for preference for one year. In these cases, it is not necessary to create new written or electronic certifications for each individual shipment.

The Omani Government will determine the exact manner that such a claim will be made. Although the U.S.-Oman FTA specifically provides for the importer to make a claim of origin and to provide supporting information, a U.S. exporter should work with the importer to insure that the U.S. good meets the FTA rules of origin prior to making a claim. It is also recommended that U.S. companies maintain their own records to support a claim of preferential treatment. These records could be provided to the importer if support for a claim of origin is requested by the Omani Customs Authority. Locate information on how to determine whether your good(s) meets the rule of origin requirements under the U.S.-Oman FTA. \r\n Demonstrating Eligibility for Preferential Treatment \r\n The Omani importer is required to submit to the customs authorities, upon request, a declaration setting forth all pertinent information concerning the growth, production, or manufacture of the good to support a claim of preferential treatment. In general, a product's eligibility for preferential tariff treatment may be demonstrated in a variety of ways, for example, a statement on company letterhead, a statement on a commercial invoice, or a certification. While no official form is required to demonstrate eligibility for preferential tariff treatment under the U.S. Oman FTA, there is a required list of elements that need to be included. \r\n A certification should include (at a minimum) the following information: \r\n  A description of the good, quantity, invoice numbers and bills of lading \r\n A description of the operations performed in the growth, production, or manufacture of the good in the territory of the United States and/or Oman and, where applicable, identification of the direct costs of processing operations \r\n A description of any materials used in the growth, production, or manufacture of the good that are wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of the United States and/or Oman, and a statement as to the value of such materials \r\n A description of the operations performed on, and a statement as to the origin and value of, any foreign materials used in the good that are claimed to have been sufficiently processed in the United States and/or Oman so as to be materials produced in the United States and/or Oman, or are claimed to have undergone an applicable change in tariff classification specified in Annex 3-A (Rules of Origin for Textile or Apparel) or Annex 4-A \r\n A description of the origin and value of any foreign materials used in the good that are not claimed to have been substantially transformed in the United States and/or Oman, or are not claimed to have undergone an applicable change in tariff classification specified in Annex 3-A (Rules of Origin for Textile or Apparel) or Annex 4-A. \r\n  The U.S.-Oman FTA states that Oman’s customs authority should request a declaration only when it has reason to question the accuracy of a claim of origin, when that Party's risk assessment procedures indicate that verification of a claim is appropriate, or when the Party conducts a random verification. \r\n Supporting Documentation \r\n Although the U.S.-Oman FTA does not specify, it is recommended that an exporter or producer maintain documentation to support a claim of preferential treatment for a minimum of five years from the date of importation. \r\n The Agreement provides that an importer claiming preferential treatment for a good must maintain all records and documents necessary to demonstrate the good qualified for preferential treatment for five years from the date of importation. \r\n Special Cases \r\n In some cases, a considerable amount of research into the inputs required for the production of goods is necessary in order to determine whether goods qualify for preferential treatment under the U.S.-Oman FTA. Many exporters and importers believe that the only time that a claim for preferential treatment under the FTA can be made is at the time the shipment clears customs. However, the importer may pay the non-preferential duties at the time the goods clear customs and then has up to one year from the date on which the goods were imported to make a claim for preferential treatment and apply for a refund of excess duties paid. This may happen in cases where the information required to determine that the good is originating is not available at the time of shipment.  At the time of the claim for preferential treatment and application for refund is made, the importer is required to supply a written declaration stating the good was originating at the time of importation. As with other claims for preferential treatment, additional supporting information may need to be provided upon request of the Customs authorities.

The Rules of Origin for the CAFTA-DR were largely modeled upon the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement. There are, however, some important differences, which require the close attention of the U.S. exporter. \r\n Go directly to the product specific rules of origin (Annex 4.1) (PDF) or see the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States at General Note 29, page 470. \r\n Except as otherwise provided in Chapter 4 of the CAFTA-DR, a good is deemed originating under the Agreement where: \r\n  it is wholly obtained or produced entirely in the United States, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and/or Nicaragua. \r\n  Note: \"Obtained\" has a unique meaning in the CAFTA-DR context; it does not mean \"purchased,\" but is simply used to acknowledge that production is not the only way goods are created. For a good to qualify under this criterion, it must contain no parts or materials anywhere in the production process that originated from outside the signatory countries. It is generally reserved for basic products such as those harvested, mined or fished in the signatory territories, although can include a manufactured good with no non CAFTA-DR inputs. Very few manufactured goods will qualify under this criterion. \r\n  it is produced entirely in the United States, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and/or Nicaragua using non-originating material (i.e., materials from outside the countries listed above) that satisfy the rule of origin specified in Annex 4.1 of the Agreement. See the \"How To Read the Rules of Origin\" section below for more information. \r\n A good produced entirely in the United States (and/or in one of the signatory countries of the Agreement) exclusively from materials that are already originating (by meeting the qualifications described above). \r\n  How To Read the Rules of Origin \r\n Rules of origin are written in terms of the Harmonized System (HS) of Tariff Classification. The HS classification system uses six to ten digit codes to identify goods. The first six digits of an HS number are harmonized among the majority of the world's countries. The last four digits are unique to each country. The vast majority of the product-specific rules of origin under the CAFTA-DR use an HS classification number. The United States uses Schedule B Numbers to classify exported products from the United States and these numbers are based on the international HS system. Therefore, the first step in interpreting the \"rules\" is to obtain the appropriate code for the good in question. (Note: the first two digits of an HS number are referred to as a \"chapter,\" the first four digits are called a \"heading\" (e.g., 1905), and the first six digits are called a \"subheading\" (e.g., 1905.90).) \r\n A rule of origin may consist of: \r\n  A change in tariff classification (also called a tariff shift) \r\n A regional value-content requirement \r\n Both a change in tariff classification and a regional value content requirement. \r\n  Note: It is necessary to refer to the rule associated with the product being exported. Regional value content can only be applied when it is allowed under a product-specific rule. \r\n Some Examples \r\n An example of a rule that employs a simple tariff shift is: \r\n  Rule of Origin: \"A change to heading 19.05 from any other chapter.\" \r\n Products: Breads, pastries, cakes, biscuits (HS 1905.90) \r\n Non-U.S., Central American, or Dominican input: Flour (classified in HS chapter 11), imported from Europe. \r\n  Explanation: For all final goods classified under HS headings 19.05, all non-U.S., Central American, or Dominican inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 19 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment. In this example, these baked goods would qualify for preferential treatment because the non-originating input is classified outside of HS chapter 19. In other words, the good qualifies as originating because the imported flour (i.e., the non-originating input in this example) classified under chapter 11 (HS #11.01) shifted tariff numbers from 11.01 to 19.05 when incorporated into the finished good. However, if these products were produced with non-originating mixes (i.e., not manufactured in the United States, Central America, or the Dominican Republic), which are classified in HS chapter 19, then these products would not qualify because a tariff shift at the chapter level did not occur as prescribed under this rule of origin. \r\n An example of a rule that employs both the \"tariff shift\" and \"regional value content\" is: \r\n  Rule of Origin: \"A change to heading 95.03 through 95.08 from any other chapter. or \r\n A change to subheading 9506.31 from subheading 9506.39, provided there is a regional value content (RVC) of not less than: \r\n    35 percent when the build-up method is used \r\n 45 percent when the build-down method is used \r\n   For all products classified in HS headings 95.03 through 95.08, all non-U.S., Central American, or Dominican inputs must be classified in an HS chapter other than HS chapter 95 in order for the product to obtain preferential duty treatment under the tariff shift rule alone. In this example, the golf club parts used to manufacture the golf clubs were imported from Asia and are classified within HS chapter 95 (i.e., HS #9506.39); thus the good does not meet the simple \"tariff shift\" in the first rule. Moving down to the second part of the rule, the good can still qualify as originating as long as it passes the regional value content test. \r\n Regional Value Content \r\n The Regional Value Content test allows the good to qualify using either one of two methods. These are the build-down and build-up methods. \r\n Build-down method: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = (( Adjusted Value - Value of Non-Originating Materials)/Adjusted Value)X 100 \r\n Build-up method: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = (Value of Originating Materials/Adjusted Value) X 100 \r\n Using the example above then: \r\n We will assume that the adjusted value for the piece of golf clubs in question is $500.00. \r\n Note: Adjusted value is the invoice value (determined in accordance with Articles 1 through 8, Article 15 and corresponding interpretative notes of the Customs Valuation Agreement), adjusted if necessary to exclude any costs, charges, or expenses incurred for transportation, insurance, and related services incident to the international shipment of the merchandise from the country of exportation to the place of importation. \r\n For non-originating materials used in the production of a good, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of that material in accordance with Article 4.4: \r\n  The costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material within a Party's territory or between territories of two or more Parties to the location of the producer; \r\n Duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, including credit against duty or tax paid or payable \r\n The cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of renewable scrap or by-product \r\n the cost of originating materials used in the production of the non-originating material in the territory of a Party \r\n  We will also assume that the value of non-originating materials in this case is $250.00. Plugging this into the build-down formula: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = ($500 - $250)/$500 X 100 = 50% \r\n Therefore, the good qualifies because the resultant percentage is greater than the 45% required by the rule. \r\n If instead, we use the build-up-formula: \r\n Regional Value Content (RVC) = $250/$500 X 100 = 50% \r\n The RVC is again 50% and is greater than the 35% required by the rule. With either method, the good specified in this example qualifies as originating under the CAFTA-DR. \r\n Note: the percentage of RVC content may vary from 25 percent to 65 percent, so it is important that you review the specific requirements stated in Annex 4.1 for your goods. \r\n Other Factors \r\n A thorough reading of Chapter Four of the CAFTA-DR is necessary for anyone attempting to determine the origin of a product, and thus, whether it is eligible for preferential duty treatment. However, below are some of the factors, beyond the product-specific rules of origin, which may be considered in making a determination of origin. \r\n De Minimis Rule \r\n All non-originating materials used in the production of the finished good that do not undergo a change in tariff classification are considered originating if the value of all those non-originating materials does not exceed ten percent of the adjusted value of the good, i.e., the de minimis amount. This is provided that the good meets all other applicable qualification criteria set forth in Chapter 4. The de minimis rule does not apply when using the “build-down” method to calculate the RVC. The value of all non-originating materials used in the production of a good must be included in the calculation. \r\n For textiles and apparel, please refer to Article 3.25.7 and Annex 4.1 of the CAFTA-DR for the relevant de minimis rule. \r\n There are some cases where the de minimis rule does not apply. To review these exceptions, go to Annex 4.6 of the CAFTA-DR. For textiles and apparel refer to Article 3.25.7. \r\n Accumulation \r\n Originating goods or materials refers from one or more Parties to the CAFTA-DR that are incorporated into a good in the territory of another Party to the Agreement are considered originating materials of the Party where the incorporation takes place. \r\n Reminder: A good is originating when the good is produced in the territory of one or more of the countries participating in CAFTA, provided that the good qualifies under the rules, as discussed above, of the CAFTA-DR. \r\n Fungible Goods and Materials \r\n Fungible goods or materials refers to goods or materials that are interchangeable for commercial purposes and whose properties are essentially identical. The CAFTA-DR allows importers to claim a fungible good or material as originating where the importer, exporter, or producer has either physically segregated each fungible good or material or used any inventory management system that is recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or is otherwise accepted by the party where the production is performed. Examples of inventory methods include: averaging, last-in first-out (LIFO), or first-in first-out (FIFO). Please note that physical separation of the goods is not necessary, but may be used for each fungible good or material. \r\n Indirect Materials \r\n Indirect materials are considered to be originating materials regardless of where they are produced. An indirect material is defined as a good used in the production, testing, or inspection of a good, but not physically incorporated into the good, or a good used in the maintenance of buildings or the operation of equipment associated with the production of a good, including: \r\n  Fuel and energy \r\n Tools, dies, and molds \r\n Spare parts, and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings \r\n Lubricants, greases, compounding materials, and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings \r\n Gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment, and supplies \r\n Equipment, devices, and supplies used for testing or inspecting the good \r\n Catalysts and solvents \r\n Any other goods that are not incorporated into the good but whose use in the production of the good can reasonably be demonstrated to be a part of that production. \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-05","title":"U.S.-CAFTA-DR Free Trade Agreement Rules of Origin","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["CAFTA-DR"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Costa Rica","Dominican Republic","El Salvador","Guatemala","Honduras","Nicaragua"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"105","content":" The U.S.-Singapore FTA went into effect on January 1, 2004.  It was the first U.S. FTA signed with an Asian nation and the first FTA signed by President George W. Bush. The FTA resulted in immediate zero tariffs on all U.S. products. \r\n Before and After the U.S.-Singapore FTA: \r\n  Overall Trade in Goods between the United States and Singapore was $35.7 billion in 2005, an increase of 2.24% over 2004. Trade in 2004, the first full year of implementation, was $34.9 billion, an increase of 10.3% over 2003’s trade of $31.6 billion. \r\n U.S. exports to Singapore grew to $20.6 billion in 2005 compared to $19.6 billion in 2004, a 5.3% increase.  U.S. exports to Singapore in 2004 increased 18.8% over 2003’s $16.5 billion. \r\n U.S. imports from Singapore decreased to $15.1 billion in 2005 from $15.3 billion in 2004, a 1.6% decrease. U.S. imports in 2003, prior to the FTA implementation, were $15.1 billion. \r\n The U.S. trade surplus with Singapore tripled during the first year of FTA implementation, reaching $4.3 billion in 2004, and $5.5 billion in 2005. \r\n In 2005, Singapore was our 11th largest trading partner (exports and imports combined). \r\n Singapore ranks 2nd on the World Bank Group's Index on \"Ease of Doing Business in 2006,\" one position above the United States and just below New Zealand. \r\n  Benefits of the FTA \r\n Investment: The U.S. -- Singapore FTA prohibits imposing performance-related requirements in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, sale or other disposition of an investment. Singapore has a generally open investment regime, and no overarching screening process for foreign investment. Singapore places no restrictions on reinvestment or repatriation of earnings and capital. However, Singapore maintains limits on foreign investment in broadcasting, the news media, domestic retail banking, property ownership, and some government-linked companies. Data on US FDI into Singapore has been largely suppressed to avoid disclosure of data of individual companies; Singapore FDI into US totaled $840 million in 2004. \r\n Services: The U.S. -- Singapore FTA reflects a substantial advance beyond Singapore’s commitments on services trade under the WTO Agreement on Trade and Services.  The FTA guarantees U.S. firms enhanced access to key services markets in Singapore, particularly in the financial services, express delivery, and professional services sectors, and locks in current open access in other key services markets such as telecommunications. \r\n Government Procurement: Singapore's government procurement process is generally open, though the FTA provides additional government procurement access to U.S. firms by expanding the contracts that are subject to FTA disciplines. \r\n IPR: In line with its FTA commitments, Singapore has developed one of the strongest IPR regimes in Asia. Amendments to the Trademarks Act and the Patents Act, a new Plant Varieties Protection Act, and a new Manufacture of Optical Discs Act came into effect in July 2004. Amended Copyright and Broadcasting Acts came into effect in January 2005, and further amendments to the Copyright Act came into effect in August 2005. Singapore is also a signatory to the major international IPR agreements administered by the WIPO, which opened Secretariat offices in Singapore in June 2005.

The FTA went into force on January 1, 2009. \r\n The FTA between the United States and Oman spurs U.S. trade with Oman in goods and services by eliminating most tariff and nontariff barriers. Under the market access provisions of the FTA, the United States and Oman provided each other immediate duty-free access for tariff lines covering almost all consumer and industrial goods and 87% of all agricultural tariff lines. Both countries agreed to phase out all tariffs on the remaining eligible goods within 10 years. \r\n The FTA contains trade facilitation measures designed to expedite the movement of goods and the provision of services between Oman and the United States; investment provisions intended to strengthen protections for U.S. investors operating in Oman, including allowing them to fully own a business without a local partner; and provisions on safeguards, intellectual property rights, government procurement, labor, environment, and dispute settlement to improve the regulatory climate for bilateral trade and investment. \r\n By Sector \r\n In 2010, U.S. exports to Oman totaled $1.1 billion. Growth sectors included organic chemicals, optical and medical instruments, plastics, and iron and steel products. Principal U.S. exports to Oman in 2010 were vehicles, machinery, and electrical machinery. \r\n Additional Information \r\n  U.S. -- Oman Free Trade Agreement legal text \r\n Country Data for Oman \r\n Find an Export Assistance Center \r\n ","pub_date":"2013-01-05","title":"The U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":[],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Oman"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"97","content":" In order to fill out a NAFTA Certificate of Origin, first you must determine if the product qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA Rules of Origin. \r\n Once you have determined that your product qualifies for NAFTA, read below for how to declare that the product qualifies for preferential tariff treatment. \r\n NAFTA Certificate of Origin \r\n The exporter is responsible for filling out the NAFTA Certificate of Origin, not the importer. \r\n Once an exporter has determined the product qualifies for NAFTA, the exporter needs to fill out a NAFTA Certificate of Origin UNLESS the product going to Canada or Mexico is valued at LESS than $1,000 USD. In these cases, the exporter simply needs to make a written declaration on the commercial invoice stating that the product is NAFTA qualifying. \r\n NAFTA Certificate of Origin (pdf from Customs and Border Protection) \r\n Fill out the NAFTA Certificate of Origin online. \r\n For more detailed information on how to fill out the NAFTA Certificate of Origin see the videos below: \r\n  NAFTA Certificate of Origin Part I and Part II\n \r\n NAFTA Preference Criteria \r\n  Once the Certificate is completed, the exporter needs to send the original or a copy of the Certificate of Origin to the importer. It is recommended that a copy of the Certificate of Origin is also included with the shipment. The exporter is required to keep all documentation of NAFTA claims until five years or such longer period as a Party may specify after the completion of the transaction. \r\n Instructions on Filling out the Certificate of Origin \r\n Block 1: The Name, Address, and Tax Identification number of the exporter. \r\n Block 2: This block is optional. If the exporter ships the same product to the same importer on a frequent basis, the exporter only needs to fill out one Certificate of Origin each year and put in the blanket period the time period (up to one year). \r\n Block 3: Enter the name and address of the producer. NOTE: If the person filling out the form wants to keep the name of the producer confidential, then write: AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMS UPON REQUEST is sufficient. \r\n Block 4: The name, address, and tax identification number of the importer. \r\n Block 5: Provide a description of the goods. \r\n Block 6: Enter the first SIX digits of the HS Tariff Classification Number, also commonly referred to as the Schedule B number. \r\n Block 7: The preference criterion tells customs how the exporter determined the product qualifies for NAFTA preferential tariff treatment. There are 6 categories. \r\n  It must contain no non-North American parts or materials anywhere in the production process. This category is generally reserved for basic products such as those harvested, mined or fished in the NAFTA territory, although it can include a manufactured good with no non-NAFTA inputs. \r\n For products manufactured in the NAFTA region that have a foreign component but met the product's rule of origin requirement. \r\n For goods produced entirely in Canada, Mexico and/or the United States exclusively from materials that are already originating. \r\n In very few cases a good that has not met the rule of origin requirement can qualify for preferential NAFTA treatment if a regional value content requirement is met. \r\n This applies to certain automatic data processing goods and their parts, specified in Annex 308.1. \r\n Applies to certain agricultural goods imported into Mexico. For more information, please call the Foreign Agricultural Service at (202) 720-7420. \r\n  Block 8: Enter yes if you are the producer of the good. Enter no if you are not the producer of the good. \r\n Block 9: Net Cost: Enter NC if the rule of origin requires a regional value content qualification and if you use the net cost method rather than the transaction value method. In ALL other instances enter NO. \r\n Block 10: Enter country of origin. Only US, CA, MX, or JT (meaning jointly produced in Mexico and the United States) should be inputted in this block. \r\n Block 11: Sign and enter the name and additional information of the person filling out the form. \r\n Special Cases \r\n In some cases, a considerable amount of research into the inputs in the production of the goods is required in order to determine origin. Many exporters and importers believe that the only time that the declaration of origin can be provided is at the time the shipment clears customs, creating a sense of urgency in determining the origin of the goods. To obtain the reduced duty rate immediately, this is true. The importer, however, could pay the non-preferential duties at the time the goods clear customs and then has up to one year from the date on which the goods were imported to apply for a refund of excess duties paid as a result of the good not being accorded preferential treatment at the time of entry. At the time of the application for refund, the importer is required to supply a written declaration of the goods' originating status, a copy of the Certificate of Origin and other documentation relating to the importation of the good that the Party may require. \r\n In some situations, an exporter may find that multiple shipments of identical goods are being sent to the same importer in Canada or Mexico. In these cases, it is not necessary to create new written declarations of origin for each individual shipment. The exporter can fill out the blanket period section of the form with two dates up to one year apart, and during that time period, the importer can maintain that one certificate of origin and present it at Customs at the acceptance of each shipment. \r\n Supporting Documentation \r\n The issuer of a written declaration of origin is required to have it available, in addition to other supporting documentation used in demonstrating that the good qualifies as originating under the NAFTA rules of origin, for a period of FIVE years from the date of importation of the good for products going to Canada and for a period of TEN years from the date of importation of the good for products going to Mexico. \r\n For more information on the NAFTA, please go to Chapter 6 of NAFTA: A Guide to Customs Procedures ","pub_date":"2013-01-05","title":"North American Free Trade Agreement Documenting Origin","update_date":"2013-04-30","evergreen":null,"content_type":[],"export_phase":[],"industry":[],"topic":[],"subtopic":["NAFTA"],"trade_region":[],"geo_region":[],"geo_subregion":[],"country":["Canada","Mexico"],"keyword":[]},{"id":"134","content":" Leverage the knowledge and influence of the U.S. government and our vast global network of international business experts, contacts and partners. \r\n With offices in more than 100 U.S. cities and 80 countries across the globe, the U.S. government offers U.S. companies exporting information, advice and cost-effective end-to-end international business solutions. \r\n Whether you are new to international sales, trying to enter a new market or looking to expand your business in a specific market here is how we can help you: \r\n International Sales and Marketing \r\n  \nInformation and Counseling -- access online resources and get personalized counseling \r\n \nStrategy and Planning -- access online resources and get personalized counseling \r\n \nMarket Research Resources -- target the best international markets and evaluate potential overseas business partners \r\n \nAdvertising and Promotional Events -- increase your brand awareness and market exposure in countries around the world \r\n \nMarket Entry and Expansion -- find and establish relationships with potential overseas business partners \r\n \nAdvocacy and Dispute Resolution -- get help competing for foreign government contracts and settling payment disputes \r\n  Export Promotion Magazine \r\n  \nCommercial News USA is a print and online magazine that reaches more than a quarter million readers in 178 countries worldwide, and more than 23,000 visitors per month online.

The Export Trade Certificate of Review enables firms to work together to reduce export costs and risks while developing new export business opportunities. Read what program participant's have to say. \r\n The Export Trade Certificate of Review program provides firms with a federal preclearance for proposed joint export activities, and conveys legal benefits that serve to protect the Certificate holder's and members' business and personal assets from costly lawsuits. Participants are protected from being sued by state and federal plaintiffs. Moreover, participants receive unparalleled reduced exposure at the private business level where most antitrust litigation takes place. \r\n Firms that team-up for exporting can gain many of the size advantages often enjoyed by larger corporations.
