<div class="content"> Santiago, Chile 
 April 15-16, 2013 
 ** Update #1: Assistant Secretary of Commerce Nicole Lamb-Hale to Lead RE&amp;EE Trade Policy Mission to Chile. Assistant Secretary Lamb-Hale is the co-chair of the interagency Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee Working Group on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency, which implements the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Export Initiative (RE4I). In 2012, she led a similar trade mission to Saudi Arabia that included 13 U.S. companies active in the solar, smart grid, and green building sectors. 
   
 ** Update #2: Kallman Worldwide to Cover Trade Mission Fee for U.S. Companies that Exhibit at IFT Energy 2013 Trade Show Immediately Following the RE&amp;EE Trade Policy Mission. Firms must be approved for participation in the RE&amp;EE trade policy mission and exhibit in a standard 9 square meter booth space at the trade show. Companies do not have to exhibit at IFT to join the mission, but offer is only valid for firms that participate in both the mission and the trade show. Interested companies should contact Matthew Hilgendorf for more information. 




 


 The U.S. Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration (ITA) is organizing a Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RE&amp;EE) Trade Policy Mission to Santiago, Chile from April 15 - 16, 2013. The mission is designed to be led by a senior Department of Commerce official, and will focus on: 1) creating a policy environment conducive to growth in Chile’s RE&amp;EE market; and 2) introducing U.S. RE&amp;EE exporters to key Chilean Government officials, and 3) networking and exploring business opportunities with select private sector interests. 



 
 



 


 The RE&amp;EE trade policy mission will promote the competitiveness of U.S. wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, waste-to-energy, smart grid, and energy efficiency exporters in a key emerging market and demonstrate U.S. Government support for Chile’s renewable energy goals. Trade policy mission participants will: 
 
  Accompany a senior-level Department of Commerce official to meetings with the Government of Chile on renewable energy and energy efficiency policy; 
 Receive an invitation to an ambassador’s reception for networking with Chilean officials and companies; 
 Participate in a symposium on Chilean RE&amp;EE opportunities hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Chile; and 
 Receive in-depth market information from the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, including opportunities, challenges, and long-term projections of the Chilean RE&amp;EE market. 
  
 Mission participants will also be encouraged to showcase their U.S.-made RE&amp;EE technologies at the International Fair of Technologies (IFT) Energy 2013 trade show immediately following the trade mission (April 17-19, 2013). Participation in the IFT Energy 2013 trade show must be arranged separately by interested firms and is not included in the trade policy mission’s registration fees.

 COMMERCIAL SETTING 
 Chile’s fast-growing economy has caused a surge in energy demand, creating opportunities for U.S. companies capable of providing technology and services to the growing Chilean RE&amp;EE market. Estimates indicate that Chile must install an additional 8 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity by 2020 to meet its growing demand. Fortunately, Chile possesses some of the world’s largest potential for renewable energy, despite little development occurring to date. 
 By 2011, Chile had installed only 0.198 GW of wind capacity, for example, despite an estimated potential of up to 10 GW. Likewise, Chile has developed only about half its biomass potential and has a small fraction of at least 2 GW of geothermal potential under development. Chile’s solar potential is one of the largest in the world and – like other renewable energy technologies – has been largely undeveloped. 
 Chile’s new National Energy Strategy contains six pillars: energy efficiency; renewable energy; traditional fossil fuels; smart grid; competition in electricity distribution; and regional electricity distribution. As such, the mission will occur at an opportune time, as Chilean policy makers seek to establish policies to support the deployment of renewable energy. 
 MISSION GOALS 
 The trade policy mission combines the policy development and advocacy efforts of a traditional trade policy mission with networking and business outreach opportunities for participating firms. The delegation will have a unique opportunity to meet government officials, discuss policy concerns, and suggest creative solutions to Chile’s energy challenges. Several topics pertinent to the creation of a thriving renewable energy market will be addressed, including: 
 
  Establishment of incentives to help Chile meet the goals of its National Energy Strategy; 
 Development of interconnection standards and feed-in tariffs that would attract global investment and provide an incentive for development; 
 Mapping of renewable energy resources; 
 Strengthening of policy and regulatory cooperation between the United States and Chile; and 
 Development of local financing institutions to further encourage development.
