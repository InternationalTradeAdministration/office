 "It gives me special pride to see our local companies competing internationally, said Congressman Neal. American products are the best products in the world. Hyde's success is proof of that." 
 Hyde Tools is a Southbridge-based manufacturer of high quality commercial knives and home maintenance products for both professionals as well as do-it-yourself homeowners. Don Cummings, vice president of international sales at Hyde, consulted with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Commercial Service about increasing Hyde's sales leads internationally.

Cummings said Hyde is very pleased with the exposure it has received from Commercial News USA, and the services of the U.S. Commercial Service, Hyde lives on sales leads and Commercial News USA produces them for us, he said.
