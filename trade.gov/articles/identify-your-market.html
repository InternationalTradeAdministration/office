<div class="content"> To succeed in exporting, you must first identify the most profitable international markets for your products or services. Without proper guidance and assistance, however, this process can be time consuming and costly — particularly for a small business. 
 Here are a few tips: 
 
  Thorough market research is key to success. Understanding your export markets will give you vital information about how to manage your efforts. 
 Do not choose too many markets. For most small businesses, three foreign markets will be more than enough, initially. You may want to test one market and then move on to secondary markets as your experience level develops. 
 Focusing on regional, geographic clusters of countries can also be more cost effective than choosing markets scattered around the globe.
