<div class="content"> Negotiations for the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA) were launched January 26, 2004 in Manama, Bahrain. Negotiations were completed on May 27, 2004 and the FTA was signed on September 14, 2004. On January 11, 2006, legislation was signed implementing the US-Bahrain FTA. The Agreement entered into force on August 1, 2006. 
 Bahrain is the first U.S. FTA partner on the Arabian Peninsula and the third FTA partner among Arab countries (Jordan and Morocco are the others). 
 Services account for roughly 50 percent of Bahrain's GDP and their services sector provides many business opportunities for U.S. firms. Bahrain has a very progressive banking sector and the country is considered the banking center of the Middle East. Bahrain has embarked on a series of progressive economic and political reforms in recent years making them a model for economic development in the region. 
 The Department of Commerce's Market Access and Compliance offices will be monitoring this Agreement to ensure that Bahrain fully complies with its trade obligations. If you encounter problems under the U.S.-Bahrain FTA, please contact our Agreements Compliance office.
