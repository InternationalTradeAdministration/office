<div class="content"> EPA has finalized emission standards for new Category 3 marine diesel engines (engines with per cylinder displacement at or above 30 liters) installed on U.S. vessels. The standards are part of a coordinated strategy to address emissions from ocean-going vessels (OGV) and are an important step in EPA's ongoing National Clean Diesel Campaign (NCDC).
