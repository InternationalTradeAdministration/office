 Alemite Corporation, headquartered in Fort Mill, SC, was established in 1918 and is a leading worldwide provider of lubrication and fluid handling systems and equipment, including pumps, reels, grease fittings, grease guns, automatic lubrication systems and related accessories. The company has made some strategic decisions over the past few years, knowing that the export market must be a large part of their growth focus. 
 When Alemite moved their headquarters to Fort Mill in 2005, the International Sales Manager for Europe and the Middle East established contact with the U.S. Commercial Service and The Export Consortium. The Export Consortium prepared a market study focusing on 9 target countries and a number of industry sectors. 
 The European Sales Manager recently stated, "We followed the advice of S.C. International Trade Coalition members by implementing critical steps to achieve export growth. We made the decision to participate in major international trade shows such as Automechanika in Frankfurt, Bauma in Munich and Agrictechnica in Hanover. Establishing connections with organizations in the Coalition has benefited our company greatly. Our staff members regularly participate in seminars &amp; workshops organized by Coalition members that help train and keep our team up-to-date on current trade issues.” 
 Alemite has recently increased their market in Ireland by adding a new distributor to their network. Alemite plans to utilize the U.S. Commercial Service's Gold Key Service for several countries in 2007 to help achieve their goal of expanding Alemite’s distribution network into Central Europe and Eastern Europe, as well as the Middle East.
