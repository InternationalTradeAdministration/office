<div class="content"> The federal government offers a number of grant programs to help your company test foreign markets, orient itself in a new market, train U.S. or foreign representatives, and overcome in-country obstacles to trade. 
 U.S Trade Development Agency Grants 
 The U.S. Trade Development Agency funds various forms of technical assistance, feasibility studies, training, orientation visits and business workshops that support the development of a modern infrastructure and a fair and open trading environment. 
 USTDA's grants support sound investment policy and decision-making in host countries and helps U.S. companies enter foreign markets and bid on infrastructure projects. USTDA is uniquely positioned to work with U.S. firms and host countries giving emphasis to industry sectors that may benefit from U.S. exports of goods and services.Â  
 The SABIT Grant Program 
 Looking to do business in Russia and the NIS? While Eurasian markets are full of opportunity, there are an equal number of risks that must be managed for this potential to be realized. Success comes from defining the right strategy and an innovative approach. 
 The SABIT Grant Program covers a share of the costs of hosting Eurasian managers and scientists for three to six months of hands-on professional training. These "executive interns" return with a better understanding and relationship of the U.S. host-company and industry. 
 Grants.gov 
 Grants.gov is the the electronic storefront for the U.S. public to access all federal grants programs.
