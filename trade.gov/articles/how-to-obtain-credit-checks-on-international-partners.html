<div class="content"> The U.S. Commercial Service's International Company Profile service provides you with financial reports on companies in over 80 countries. 
 Our worldwide network of specialists can investigate the financial strength of a company and provide useful information gleaned from the local press, industry contacts, and other sources. These reports are required by many export financing organizations. 
 We can provide: 
 A detailed credit report on a prospective overseas sales representative or partner in approximately 15 days or by the date negotiated with the overseas' office.
 A listing of the company's key officers and senior management. 
 Banking and other financial information about the company 
 Market information, including sales and profit figures, and potential liabilities 
  The U.S. Commercial Service will also provide you with an opinion as to the viability and reliability of the overseas company or individual you have selected as well as an opinion on the relative strength of that company's industry sector in your target market. 
 To order an International Company Profile, contact an Export Assistance Center.
