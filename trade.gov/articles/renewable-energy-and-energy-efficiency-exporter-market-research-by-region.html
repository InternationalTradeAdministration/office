Biodiesel production is estimated to grow steadily in 2012 and 2013 reflecting the implementing of mandatory B5 biodiesel use. [June 2012] 
 Japan Focuses on Next Generation Biofuels  
 In 2011, Japanese ethanol and biodiesel production increased but remained at low levels. Imports of ethanol for fuel and other uses also increased while ETBE imports in 2011 held steady. Due to limited agricultural production, and the “food vs. fuel” debate, the Government of Japan has opted to focus determinedly on biofuels derived from cellulosic materials or other materials which do not compete with the food supply. Nevertheless, overall Japanese production of biofuels is expected to continue expanding. [June 2012] 
 Australia: 2012 Biofuels Report 
 Imports of Biodiesel from the United States are subject to a “Countervailing Duty” and “Dumping Duty” which is expected to be in place for a total of five years and, per calculations, would expire in April 2016. Despite these measures, official trade data shows the continued importation of biodiesel from overseas suppliers, including the US and Canada. The United States and Australia are also collaborating on research and development regarding the safe use of sustainable aviation alternative fuels. [June 2012] 
 Thailand Imposes Export Surcharge on Crude Palm Oil

 Philippines: Biofuels 
 The Philippines is a regional pioneer in renewable energy (RE) and has biofuels legislation in place that calls for the blending of ethanol and biodiesel in gasoline and diesel fuel. RE sources accounted for 43 percent of the country’s primary energy mix in 2009. However, its contribution to total power supply is likely to decline in the next five years due to its comparatively higher cost and the preference of local officials to turn to familiar sources of power to address rapidly growing demand. Ethanol imports are expected to increase through at least 2012 in order to satisfy local ethanol-blended gasoline requirements. [August 2011] 
 India: Biofuels 
 Biofuel production and consumption in India is at its nascent stage and is evolving. The Government of India (GOI) approved the National Policy on Biofuels on December 24, 2009. The policy proposes a target of 20 percent blending of biofuel both for bio-diesel and bio-ethanol by 2017.

 France's Strategy to Implement Renewable Energy Directive 
 In this USDA report, it is noted that France is the European Union's second largest producer and consumer of renewable energies, which represented 12 percent of France's total energy production in 2009, mainly including wood, water, biofuels, and urban waste. As part of the European Energy Renewable Energy Directive adopted in 2009, France's objectives is to increase its renewable energy share to 23 percent by 2020. France is expected to transpose the Directive into national law in January 2011. The French biofuels industry submitted a voluntary certification scheme, validated by a French certification agency, to the European Commission in order to get certification and be eligible for counting towards the target and for receiving public support. In 2009, total biofuels consumption represented 6.04 percent of transportation fuels. France's national target in 2010 is 7 percent, and generally considered realistic by the industry and research centers. [December 2010]

 Belgium: Biogas Market Brief 
 There are very few Belgian companies and consultancy firms that specialize in biogas. Research on biogas has come mainly from trade associations, agricultural research groups, and universities in Belgium. Materials, installations, and consultancies are often provided by foreign companies, many from Germany. Because of little competition input and maintenance costs are relatively high. Industry trends suggest that the market could benefit from low cost products and consulting services. [August 2010] 
 Introduction of E10 may curb biodiesel consumption in Germany  
 The German Government has doubled to 10% the allowable amount of ethanol in gasoline. Starting January 1, 2011, E10,a gasoline mix of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent bioethanol by volume, will be freely sold in Germany. This is expected to increase bioethanol demand and imports. However, because the overall biofuel mandate remains unchanged it is also expected that increase in bioethanol market share may reduce consumption of biodiesel in Germany. [November 2010]

 Buenos Aires Biodiesel Tax Increase and Temporary Soybean Import Policy 
 The Government of Argentina (GOA) recognizes that the biodiesel industry has contributed quite a bit to Argentina’s industrialization of the soy industry. In fact, production has more than tripled over the last five years and more than half of production is exported. However, last year, supplies were short because of a hard hit drought and in March 2012, members of the crushing industry asked the GOA to consider raising soybean export taxes in order to promote more incentive to crush in-country. Temporary imports of soybeans will be allowed into Argentina for the purpose of crushing in-country to fill the gap in crushing capacity. [August 2012]
