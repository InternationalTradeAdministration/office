<div class="content"> This Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) presents the health and welfare benefits, costs, and other impacts of the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) in 2016. This rule will reduce emissions of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP), including mercury, from the electric power industry. As a co-benefit, the emissions of certain PM2.5 precursors such as SO2 will also decline. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that this final rule will yield annual monetized benefits (in 2007$) of between $37 to $90 billion using a 3% discount rate and $33 to $81 billion using a 7% discount rate. The great majority of the estimates are attributable to co-benefits from 4,200 to 11,000 fewer PM2.5-related premature mortalities.
